Even though it was tempting to still continue with the handbook, priorities (self-imposed and self-enforced) were clear: <code>\"Challenge or nothing!\"</code>. Althought Friday was whispering: \"Pick nothing, pick nothing! Nothing is c-h-ool\". But I manged some improvements which were IMMEDIATELY approved. Like really? Before I was waiting for feedback sometimes for 3 weeks. Now it took like 3 minutes. Power of Friday I guess :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      After-work afternoon and evening were <code>EPIC</code>:\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      - amazing company\n      <br />\n      - quality conversation\n      <br />\n      - Magic\n      <br />\n      - lots of fun while dancing because <code>Some like it Hot</code>\n      <br />\n      - fantastic dinner in the fairyland of Peter Pan\n\t    <br />\n      <br />\n      What more to wish?

You have <code>30 seconds</code> to engage your fellow travellers (who happen to be your colleagues) in a very serious conversation about very serious topics like weather and stuff :) As I find weather topic boring, I usually ask <code>\"how are you?\"</code> But not out of politeness as most people do who never expect or interest themselves in the actual answer. I usually am genuinely interested in what they say :) Especially after the weekend, I am eager to hear those weekend stories, how people spend their life outside of work. But as it happens to be a Monday, the answer to <code>\"how are you?\"</code> is however typically: <code>\"Yeah, you know.. Monday\"</code>.\n   <blockquote>\n   For most work-bound souls, Monday has become an <code>adjective.</code> Monday has become the the <code>state</code> of spirit.\n   </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n    But when I ask people how they are, it is also for me a small retrospective moment to actually give a brief check on my own emotional state. And what I surprisingly found this particular Monday was that I was actually <code>looking forward</code> to go to job! Just like entire last week. And so unlike so many weeks before. Tracing back to... years even. Wow, what a delightful plot twist. What a peaceful feeling that it <code>is</code> actually possible to like the job and to be (at least for a brief moment in life)... simply <code>content</code>.\n    <br />\n    <br />\n    The peaceful moment lasted.. for about that lift ride :) As afterwards I tried to make another repo work on my local, following very short guide (5 instructions) and failed on the very last one. Error message was quite clear: <code>Low on disc space</code>.. What was not clear though was... how on EARTH I can run out of disc space after [one, ein, um, jeden] week of having brand new pc? Aaaanyhow, seems like issue with initial system installation. And... Dom is on holiday. Issue will have to wait till Wednesday.
