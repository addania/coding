Yes, yes, dear Austrians: ein\n      Tag mit Muskelkater :) from previous day(s) of intense training and ...\n      let's admit it... carrying that <code>MohnKuchen</code> all the way to the\n      office.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day deeply satisfying as I finally achieved my long desired goal.\n      The hard work for past months has finally paid off. Dream turning\n      inevitably into reality right in front of my eyes. It seems a bit surreal,\n      it seems a bit... well plain even, earthy maybe.

Althought Friday was whispering:\n      \"Pick nothing, pick nothing! Nothing is c-h-ool\". But I manged some\n      improvements which were IMMEDIATELY approved. Like really? Before I was\n      waiting for feedback sometimes for 3 weeks. Now it took like 3 minutes.\n      Power of Friday I guess :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      After-work afternoon and evening were <code>EPIC</code>:\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      - amazing company\n      <br />\n      - quality conversation\n      <br />\n      - Magic\n      <br />- lots of fun while dancing because <code>Some like it Hot</code>\n      <br />\n      - fantastic dinner in the fairyland of Peter Pan\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      What more to wish? Soles of my feet burnt from dancing: L.I.T.E.R.A.L.L.Y.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      This day was <code>LEGEN..wait for it..DARY</code>\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sxv0av1.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by https://estiloswing.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/tecnica-lindy-5.jpg\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 5: 09.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      You know how those <code>lift conversations</code> go.. You have{\" \"}\n      <code>30 seconds</code> to engage your fellow travellers (who happen to be\n      your colleagues) in a very serious conversation about very serious topics\n      like weather and stuff :) As I find weather topic boring, I usually ask{\" \"}\n      <code>\"how are you?\"</code> But not out of politeness as most people do\n      who never expect or interest themselves in the actual answer. I usually am\n      genuinely interested in what they say :) Especially after the weekend, I\n      am eager to hear those weekend stories, how people spend their life\n      outside of work. But as it happens to be a Monday, the answer to{\" \"}\n      <code>\"how are you?\"</code> is however typically:{\" \"}\n      <code>\"Yeah, you know.. Monday\"</code>.\n      <blockquote>\n        For most work-bound souls, Monday has become an <code>adjective.</code>{\" \"}\n        Monday has become the the <code>state</code> of spirit.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      But when I ask people how they are, it is also for me a small\n      retrospective moment to actually give a brief check on my own emotional\n      state. And what I surprisingly found this particular Monday was that I was\n      actually <code>looking forward</code> to go to job! Just like entire last\n      week. And so unlike so many weeks before. Tracing back to... years even.\n      Wow, what a delightful plot twist. What a peaceful feeling that it{\" \"}\n      <code>is</code> actually possible to like the job and to be (at least for\n      a brief moment in life)... simply <code>content</code>.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The peaceful moment lasted.. for about that lift ride :) As afterwards I\n      tried to make another repo work on my local, following very short guide (5\n      instructions) and failed on the very last one - installing Docker.. I am\n      cursed with this Docker, it keeps resisting my attempts to tame it. Error\n      message was quite clear: <code>Low on disc space</code>.. What was not\n      clear though was... how on EARTH I can run out of disc space after [\"one\",\n      \"ein\", \"um\", \"jeden\"] week of having brand new pc? Aaaanyhow, seems like\n      issue with initial system installation. And... Dom is on holiday. Issue\n      will have to wait till Wednesday. Time for progress on studying\n      Typescript.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Oh and evening was quite interesting. Signed up for a 1 hour meditation\n      workshop on Mindvalley. Was really pleasant to silence the thoughts and\n      enjoy some peace in my own head :)\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZJgxiKI.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Tina Nord from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 6: 10.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        It is happening..

I learned more in one day than\n      in previous 1.5 weeks. Wohaa. And I was such a good apprentice, so bright\n      and fast-learner and uncomplicated, that my mentor totally did NOT HAVE TO\n      take his laptop and move to a table right next to me, so that he doesn't\n      need to walk all way to my place every few seconds when I had another\n      thousand of questions :) Hey, at least I had a neighbour!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And as all my new colleagues are so nice to me and help me out, I decided\n      to purchase a special treat for them.\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/al6QpWq.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />I\n      called it a <s>bribe</s>.. thank-you package :)\n      <br />\n      - the 1st one for the 1st colleagues\n      <br />- the 2nd one for <s>the 2nd coll</s>.. ok, for ME.\n      <br />\n      - the rest of them, yes, for ME as well :)\n      <br />\n      One of them was already missing in the picture (that was the first one..)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The afternoon was rather confusing.

And as the company\n      announced yesterday that we all would be taking home office from next\n      Monday on and after agreement with my own boss to be able to already start\n      my home office tomorrow, I was packed with my laptop, with a huge bag with\n      all my stuff from the fridge. And seeing all other people also rushing to\n      the Bratislava train with also huge bags and some of them even with their{\" \"}\n      <code>monitors</code>... it totally felt like an...{\" \"}\n      <code>evacuation</code>. Which I guess it actually <strong>was</strong>.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Brrr... spooky train ride back home.

I try to focus on my job, but it just\n      feels strange. Kind of out of this space.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Ok, decision has been made, emergency shopping (just to be on the safe\n      side and prepared for any eventuality [of an apocalypse]):\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/F3JevVz.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      Now whatever happens, I will be fine (dose of chocolate solves every\n      problem in the world, does it not?).\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And I made a tough decision today. I was considering to travel to my\n      family in the evening or not. As tempting as it was (even having a\n      colleague who would give me a ride), I decided against it. After all I\n      have been in Vienna for past weeks where situation is much more severe\n      than in Slovakia and where I have been exposed to lots and lots of people\n      in trains, U-bahn, job, outside of job.. Which increases probability of\n      potential danger even if I do not have any symptoms. So it would not be\n      wise and responsible now to pose the same risk to my family. As much as I\n      miss them, they and their health are much more important to me than my\n      loneliness.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Anyway, today I did some QA testing for the issue implemented by my\n      colleague and then I literally spent entire day (until midnight) browsing\n      the code, playing around, testing some of my hypothesis and trying to\n      figure things out. You can tell that it was very interesting that it kept\n      me awake for so long. And I think to invest some of my private time now\n      into discovering things on my own could make a difference in long run. And\n      especially when it actually makes <code>fun</code> :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And here is my <code>home office</code> setup:\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LE1F5XE.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 10: 16.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      Feels weird when you know that entire crew is working from home office\n      today (and who knows how long) due to the emergency situation with the\n      Corona virus. Everyone is worried and starts to take the quarantine\n      seriously. You find it difficult to actually think about work as at the\n      back of your head the whole situation (which feel absurd) plays on repeat.\n      And you feel so remote, so alone, so detached from everything and\n      everyone. And then suddenly you receive a slack message from a colleague:\n      <blockquote>\n        \"Good morning! Just don't want to lose the habits of the normal life\"{\" \"}\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Yes, one must love their colleagues :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Apart from everything, today I was really motivated to make some{\" \"}\n      <code>serious</code> progress on my <code>very first </code>\n      issue. Especially because I had been planning to work on it during the\n      weekend, which... somehow... not sure how... actually did <code>\n        not\n      </code>{\" \"}\n      happen :) So I decided to make up for it today! And.. I failed..\n      miserably.\n      <br />\n      <br />I kinda knew there will be times which will be tough and when I will\n      feel stuck. But.. did they have to come, like.. <code>already</code>? Do\n      they need to come like.. <code>every 10 minutes</code>? :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Luckily my mentor is a very patient man. But even him after 50 minutes\n      call trying to actually explain to me what is expected from me in the\n      issue, even he pointed out that he hopes that now I understand since he\n      already spent 50 minutes on me :) Yes, well... hmm... felt humbling, but\n      come on, I need to understand what I should do before I can even start,\n      right? RIGHT?\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The evening was very pleasant! Spent it playing Age of Empires II online\n      with a friend! And of course we won! :) It could not have been any other\n      way, we are pros! And at least for a brief moment it did not feel so\n      lonely in this apartment. It alomst felt.... normal again.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Afterwards I decided to still browse some code, explore things on my own,\n      so that I do not feel so dumb all the time. And yes, there was a second\n      reason which I did not want to admit to myself that actually was any\n      reason... I was kind of nervous about the whole situation and that I was\n      adviced by a friend to think about making some small stock of food for\n      myself...you know.. just in case. I <code>DO NOT</code> want to admit that\n      I might need stuff for <code>just in case</code>. Because then it really\n      starts to be scary... But at the same time it is rational! But I better do\n      it tomorrow morning right when they open up (which is 6am...gosh). And\n      yes, being nervous is a <code>no-go</code> to sleep for me. So I was awake\n      till 1 am pretending to be working, while just in reality trying to make\n      myself exhausted so that I would fall asleep.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Which I did!\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LE1F5XE.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 11: 17.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        This was a weird day.

Just thinking about it was freaking me out and actually doing it\n      was really strange.. Especially, it was my first time when I decided that\n      I should actually use at least a scarf around my face (because obviously I\n      did not have any face mask, because where would I even get one??) and that\n      turned out to be actually a good decision... Everyone in the streets were\n      using them (am I still living in Slovakia?).. and there were even warnings\n      on the shop doors and windows that it is prohibited to enter the store\n      without a face mask. Wow, world <code>is</code> going crazy. This stuff is\n      real! I guess I am not misplaced doing huge shopping for \"bad\" times. And\n      I guess I should really start to look around to get myself a normal mask..\n      But how when even on the pharmacy door they had thousand posters: \"We do\n      NOT have masks\"... But I went there nevertheless... at least to ask when\n      they might have some for ordinary mortals... And when the woman saw me in\n      that huge scarf clumsily wrapped around my mouth and nose.. she actually\n      said nothing, just went to the backroom and brought one mask for me. She\n      said there was one last mask left, so that I don't suffocate behind that\n      scarf... Wow, I was so stunned that I actually got the mask when all my\n      hopes were gone... Certainly treasure loot of the day <code>is</code> the\n      mask. Funny how our rank of precious items changes under different\n      circumstances. A luxury good - a rare epic turns out nowadays to be a\n      simple small piece of white cloth and 2 strings...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Later on I could not really identify my emotional state. <br />\n      <br />\n      <code>Nervous </code>\n      from the emergency shopping.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <code>In awe</code> from the luck I had with the mask.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <code>Rage</code> that the pharmacy shop actually <code>lied</code> about\n      not having masks, even though apparently that <code>did</code> have some!\n      And also the way they are now in the position to decide who gets one and\n      who doesn't. Maybe I should not analyze, becasue I got one.. but still..\n      if the pharmacist did not feel generous, I could have gone home with empty\n      hands. And that bothers me...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The rest of the day was very busy with working on my issue. The\n      nervousness and haziness did not leave me though. Highlight certainly was\n      a virtual lunch with my colleague. It was nice to see a familiar face from\n      a fairy tale long time ago...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Around afternoon I started to be very <code>very</code> tired. As my\n      mentor pointed out.. I should not have been coding till midnight and I\n      should have rather rested in the evenings. That was actually true because\n      I was starting to feel a headache somewhere attthe back of my\n      consciousness, which did not prophet anything good. If this turns into\n      migrene, life will be very painful...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      In the evening I tried to distract myself with a nice conversation with a\n      friend. We agreed on a tea-and-cake hangout on Whatsapp. It was actually\n      very nice (even without and actual cake), but unfortunatelly my headache\n      was intensifying and soon I found myself struggling. So I had to stop the\n      ever-interesting call and head to bed... I am screwed...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Moral of the story [for my future self]: Adda, gotdammit, seriously, do\n      not be so over-ambitious and do <code>not</code> work till 1 am unless you\n      really have to. It is not worth a migrene..\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LE1F5XE.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 12: 18.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        When you wake up and the first thing your consciousness reckognizes is\n        that your head is exploding like fireworks, even after a full night\n        sleep, you know that this is going to be one very very VERY\n        looooooooooong and an utterly miserable day for you...\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      And the only thing you actually wish for right away is the day to be over.\n      But guess what... you <code>need</code> to work and you have wonderful 8\n      hours ahead of you where you are expected to deliver and perform! Yay! :)\n      What is more, being a developer means that those 8 hours will be well\n      spent staring at the computer screen (which for a migrene is the worst\n      thing imaginable) and trying to make your <code>brain</code> work. Which\n      already refuses even to think about having the eyes opened. Will be fun\n      times today.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Usually nothing helps me for the migrane, apart from suffering for 2-3\n      days and sleeping a lot. Nevertheless, I still gave it a try with 2\n      anti-migrene pills, the strongest ones I currently had in possession.\n      Those ones in particular were the best ones I could obtain in London\n      pharmacy months back when I was in similar migrene emergecy.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Today was the time to test them again. And guess what? A miracle happened!\n      The migrene stopped in around 2 hours and I was actually able to enjoy the\n      day and code until 20:40 pm :) And actually, I must say this day was\n      awesome! Because I was so happy with my performance. I did a lot of\n      progress on my issue, then also on change requests other team mates made.\n      Plus I even did a code review of an article a colleague wrote. I am\n      usually shy to do code reviews, cause... let's be honest how much relevant\n      input a Junior like me can contribute especially to code of people who are\n      10+ years experienced? Well, as this was an article about a setup I did\n      myself last week, I had some tips, omg, I actually had something to{\" \"}\n      <code>say</code> :) Feels like a queen..ehm, forget queen..{\" \"}\n      <code>goddess</code>!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So yes, today I was satisfied with my work and plenty of things which I\n      accomplished especially on my (first <code>real</code>) issue. It is\n      really a rewarding feeling when you are heading towards the finishing line\n      and you see the possibility (far away in the distance still hazy, but\n      yet...) of a <code>merge</code> :) Yes, ok, after the QA testing ofc. But\n      I already see myself on the winner platform, hugging the imaginary{\" \"}\n      <code>trophy</code> :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Speaking of trophies, time to reward myself aaand ZOCKEN ZOCKEN ZOCKEN :))\n      Hell yes, 2 days ago there was an Ubisoft sale on Steam and I finally\n      bought Heroes of Might and Magic 5. I had been hunting for this sales for\n      months now :) Yes, yes, why to pay 10€, when you can only pay 2,5€? I\n      totally made a saving on this one :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So bye bye guys, you won't see me in the next couple of hourZ... ok, ok,\n      actually (due to quarantine) in the next couple of months but at least\n      there is Internet and there are games :) Time to kill loneliness by being\n      <code>totally</code> (un)productive ;)\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 13: 19.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        There <code>is</code> hope! I see the light at the end of the tunnel\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />I worked relentlessly on all the change request <code>torture</code>{\" \"}\n      from my mentor and my colleagues. I integrated everything they wanted. And\n      now, the big time has come to move my issue to QA testing! I am soooo\n      close to having it merge to the main branch.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And then it happened... an unforgettable conversation between me and my\n      mentor, so deep and full of love, support, understandting, where he\n      expressed his undying trust in me and in my work...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Mentor: \"I will now test your PR 😄 Be prepared 😄\"\n      <br />\n      Addania: \"I DARE YOU 😄\"\n      <br />\n      Addnia: \"but you only are allowed to test it the way I described in the{\" \"}\n      <code>How to test</code> section 😉\"\n      <br />\n      Addania: \"which will purposedly skip all the necessary steps\"\n      <br />\n      Mentor: \"the <code>how to test</code> is only a guildeline, i will test\n      every file you touched, directly or indirectly 😛\"\n      <br />\n      Addania: \"now I am panicking\"\n      <br />\n      Addania: \"who cares about Corona, real danger is QA testing!\"\n      <br />\n      Mentor:\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E9NHDjW.gif\" alt=\"Photo from giphy.com\" />\n      <br />\n      Addania: \"by the way, the word from thy Emperor:\"\"\n      <blockquote>\n        Addania: \"one question, how extensive should QA testing reports be?\"\n        <br />\n        Emperor: \"not too detailed, as we are doing extensive tests later on.\n        the <code>how to test</code> section is usually a good guideline. for\n        such an issue, 5 minutes max\"\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      Addania: \"there you GO Master!

My sports group decided\n      that <code>nothing shall stop us</code> (not even a wold-wide pandemic,\n      governmental order for total quarantine, social distancing, closure of\n      borders.. and other fun stuff) and they organized a virtual training,\n      haha. Was really great and it felt almost... normal :) Great when the\n      technology is really enabling people in such difficult times (of [virus]\n      oppression).\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And later on... was simply... and to the deepest sense of it...\n      B.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L :) Had a wonderful conversation with a friend. Nothing\n      feels better than spending some quality time with quality people\n      discussing intriguing things.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 14: 20.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Drumroll... Drumroll... Drumroll...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Buidling up some tension...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Still... :)\n      <br />\n      <br />I can hear crowds cheering (from safe government-approved quarantine\n      distance)...\n      <blockquote>\n        My very first <code>real</code> PR got merged!

My\n        spirit will remain in <code>code</code>.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Parties and celebrations lasted for maybe half an hour until I began to\n      work on a new issue. Which started great, because it seemed as a very\n      similar task to the previous one and I was already starting to feel a bit\n      more comfy and tiny fraction more confident, that I actually start to\n      understand at least a bit of it.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And then I realized what the issue actually <code>is</code> about and how\n      extensive my code re-design is supposed to be. I took a break to cry, eat\n      (whatever) (...ok all of the) sweets I had at home (which by the way was\n      an entire stock of rations for a month time of apocalypse...), then I\n      cried a bit again and afterwards on the recommendation of my mentor I took\n      the first and the second look at it... and even a <code>bonus</code> third\n      one... It still looked the same... so I wrapped the working day up and\n      hoped that something magical will happen over the weekend, that on Monday\n      I will wake up and everything will be crystal clear and I simply do it...\n      Let's see...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      As a rebellion to that I decided to make progress on meaningful stuff in\n      my life... and played Heroes of Might and Magic 5 until 2 am :) And then I\n      remembered that some time ago someone mentioned to me that humans should\n      actually engage themselves in something called sleep. Fair enough, I\n      should give it a try (from time to time). But before I went I randomly\n      opened an old chat with my skiing group only to find (completely random)\n      meme:\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wZABOiR.png\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Phabulu1 from Imgur\"\n        border=\"5px\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      Those coincidences sometimes are <code>epic</code>. If only they knew :)\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 15: 23.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        Nope! Did not happen... No magical enlightment, no Nirvana. I did not\n        reach higher consciousness over the weekend.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />I feel as dumb as I did on Friday (maybe even dumber, as I do not\n      even remember what I was doing in the code on Friday). Jupiii, will be\n      hell of a day. Literally ;) Maybe my soul will burn, and <code>\n        then\n      </code>{\" \"}\n      I get enlightened! It would prove that I actually have soul.. now that\n      would be <code>interesting</code>... :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Anyhow I had to reach out to wisdoms of my mentor to guide me to the point\n      from where I could at least start. The starting point was.... to delete\n      around 10 complex files and do everything from scratch.. I shed a tear and\n      then made some very nice progress with the design itself. Who care that\n      all the functionality is missing :) The looks is important, no?\n      Nevertheless, it was fun coding today. Would be a perfect day, if only I\n      did not have to do some annoying <code>manual</code> work for my ex-boss\n      from my previous team. Who does not like filling out a 1000th spreadsheet\n      manually, even though we have the same information spread across 5\n      different softwares...? Well in year 2020 manual work FTW... (or not)...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      I decided that rather then raging over it, I wrap it up for today and then\n      I had a great after-work training with my sports group. Love to get\n      sweaty!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And now time fooooor... wait for it.... gaming :) Another online\n      multiplayer appointment is awaiting for me, therefore I better get to it.\n      I do not want to get my sweet civilization in year 2070 wait for their\n      ruler :)\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 16: 24.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        When initial shock from pandemics subsides, you begin to live your\n        ordinary life. Under new circumstanes of course, with new routine,\n        with some adjustments and workarounds. But it soon becomes the new\n        usual. Which is good. Which means you stopped panicking and start\n        adapting. Because all emotions even panic has an expiry date when your\n        body runs into emotional exhaustion and that is the breakpoint when you\n        embrace your new situation and start acting to the best of your given\n        circumstance.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So yes, days start to pass in a very similar rythm. I certainly do not miss\n      travelling 3 hours a day for job. I can sleep longer and still start my\n      working day earlier than before. Which feels much more productive. Which\n      is certainly great. Also the isolation does not YET feel that horrible.\n      Because with modern technology I do feel connected to people whom I want\n      to be in contact with. This will probably change very soon, because 1,5\n      week alone is still nothing compared to maybe months... or who knows how\n      long this situation is going to take. Prognosis do not look good at all.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Back to coding. Speaking of general productivity, yes, I certainly work\n      more and more efficient. Today my boss re-prioritized my tasks and I had\n      to start a new issue, which I was able to also finish today. But the rest\n      of the day was very scattered as I still needed to finish some manual work\n      for my ex department and some clients decided that TODAY is the perfect\n      day to snow me under with emails. So deving was not as good as I wanted it to\n      be. But as I am still in dual position, torn apart between two\n      departnemnts, I need to grinch my teeth and simply do it. Soon, very soon,\n      I can hand over all my clients and focus 101% on programming, yay!!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And today I also started to learn about redux, so that I can make progress\n      on my issue. Wow, found a great tutorial from the author of redux, great\n      stuff... not that great English accent :) I really cannot make myself not\n      mentioning it, hahahaha, as I found it so difficult to understand him from\n      time to time, but overall the tutorial is absolutely awesome, very\n      educative, very insightful! :) So google it, go for it! In case you are\n      interested.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And evening was really great! Had an upper body training with my friend.\n      My legs are still crying from the leg training with him on Sunday. Was\n      time to destroy my arms as well. So that the Addania is fisnished off\n      completely :) Now that I am thinking about it, I wonder now what his\n      intentions are.. and I even allow him to destroy me.. dammit :)\n    </p>\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport const query = graphql`\n  query {\n    site {\n      siteMetadata {\n        title\n      }\n    }\n  }\n`\n","import React from \"react\";\n\nexport default (props) => \n\n<div style={{color: \"purple\", fontSize:\"20px\"}}>\n  <h1>{props.headerText}</h1>\n</div>"],"sourceRoot":""}
