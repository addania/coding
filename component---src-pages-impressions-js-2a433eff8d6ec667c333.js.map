The day <code>0</code>, since obviously\n        all acceptably decent indices shall start with zero.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />A day a bit chaotic as I was settling in my new corner of the\n      office.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      But a day with a <code>MohnKuchen</code> which propheted an excellent day.\n      After all, what can go wrong when you have a prospect of a delicious cake\n      and warm cup of tea from our CTO (Chief Tea Officer) to combat literally\n      ANY challenge in life? They say <code>piece of cake</code> for a reason,\n      don't they? :)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day when I <i>actually</i> talked to <i>actual</i> developers. And\n      they\n      <i> actually</i> talked BACK :) Thank you <code>MohnKuchen</code> ;)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with <code>muscle tomcat</code>. Yes, yes, dear Austrians: ein\n      Tag mit Muskelkater :) from previous day(s) of intense training and ...\n      let's admit it... carrying that <code>MohnKuchen</code> all the way to the\n      office.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day deeply satisfying as I finally achieved my long desired goal.\n      The hard work for past months has finally paid off. Dream turning\n      inevitably into reality right in front of my eyes. It seems a bit surreal,\n      it seems a bit... well plain even, earthy maybe. But <code>MINE</code>.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with a small <code>victory</code> to setup my first\n      professional dev environment.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day which ended up with an intriguing <code>puzzle</code> to look\n      forward to solving the next day :)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with an after-work <code>hangout</code> which turned out to be\n      more pleasant than expected.\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>Total score: The day freaking ROCKED :)</blockquote>\n      <br />\n      And yes, the <code>cake</code> was the most important part of it :)\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aRwy8mP.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Antonio Quagliata from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 0.5: 02/03.03.2020 23:50</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        I just had this philosophical and self-critical moment wondering if this\n        diary had any added value whatsoever.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />I do not know if for you dear reader(s) (assuming there are any\n      readers... but according to my sophisticated calculations and AI based\n      predictions, there should be precisely at least one: future me), so for me\n      personally it certainly makes <code>lots</code> of fun. Especially at\n      these most creative moments at 23:50 (like <code>right now</code>) when I\n      should have been fast asleep like two hours ago and instead I am totally\n      hyped with a waterfall of ideas :))\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Anyhow, one simple blog = one (sleepless but) happier developer on Earth.\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/tH7xZhk.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Pixabay Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 1: 03.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        First things first... yes, leftovers from the <code>cake </code>\n        are still in the fridge... will be another great day :)\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      And now back to the <code>puzzle</code> from yesterday: how to hack the\n      unhackable login to the app on my LOCAL? My wildly lucky guess{\" \"}\n      <code>admin admin</code> did not work. But I got an insider tip that the\n      second half of the riddle I have solved already, muhahahaha.

It is only my\n      second day and I am totally pro already :)) ...*cough cough*\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Another achievement of the day: I made my very first{\" \"}\n      <code>code review</code> today B) It was extremely serious change request:\n      correct a typo, haha. One must always start somewhere :) Tough life of\n      beginners.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And I finally finished setup for the main app thanks to couple of (4)\n      people who helped me make it work after we realized that our internal wiki\n      is outdated and there are some backend issues.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And the highlight of the day was{\" \"}\n      <code>New Starters After-Work Pizza</code>. Technically I am not a new\n      starter in the company, however I am new starter in the dev team, so I\n      joined the event and it was hilarious to talk to my new team. They are\n      simply amazing and super funny. I love those dev jokes. I didn't want to\n      leave as I was having lots of fun, but the time was running short for my\n      Tuesday's Sports Group. It would suck if the teacher didn't arrive :)) So\n      I had to. And the yoga class was actually nice, relaxing, yet challenging.\n      Cause without a challenge it would be boring ;)\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6UF5Rk9.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Creative Vix from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 2: 04.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        Excellent, I got an Italian cooking Italian lunch for me today.

Haha, I am special (or differently talented).\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So what is up in the dev world today? Did lots of <code>VIP</code> stuff\n      (a.k.a. very important push). I wrote a major article about the initial\n      Front-End settup for any future new starter in the company, such a\n      charitable work :) I am literally a saint already.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And the <code>hallmark</code> of the day was plotting with colleagues how\n      to take over the world using robots :D Oh yes, we founded a{\" \"}\n      <code>secret</code> group of underground <code>hackers</code> called{\" \"}\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Tj5BBW9tM\">\n        Team Alpha-Super-Awesome-Cool-Dynamite-Wolf-Squadron\n      </a>{\" \"}\n      who will be meeting up after work every week and plotting terrible things.\n      The very first meeting was .. how to put it.. most interesting.

Even though it was tempting to still continue\n      with the handbook, priorities (self-imposed and self-enforced) were clear:{\" \"}\n      <code>\"Challenge or nothing!\"</code>. Althought Friday was whispering:\n      \"Pick nothing, pick nothing! Nothing is c-h-ool\". But I manged some\n      improvements which were IMMEDIATELY approved. Like really? Before I was\n      waiting for feedback sometimes for 3 weeks. Now it took like 3 minutes.\n      Power of Friday I guess :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      After-work afternoon and evening were <code>EPIC</code>:\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      - amazing company\n      <br />\n      - quality conversation\n      <br />\n      - Magic\n      <br />- lots of fun while dancing because <code>Some like it Hot</code>\n      <br />\n      - fantastic dinner in the fairyland of Peter Pan\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      What more to wish? Soles of my feet burnt from dancing: L.I.T.E.R.A.L.L.Y.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      This day was <code>LEGEN..wait for it..DARY</code>\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/sxv0av1.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by https://estiloswing.es/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/tecnica-lindy-5.jpg\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 5: 09.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      You know how those <code>lift conversations</code> go.. You have{\" \"}\n      <code>30 seconds</code> to engage your fellow travellers (who happen to be\n      your colleagues) in a very serious conversation about very serious topics\n      like weather and stuff :) As I find weather topic boring, I usually ask{\" \"}\n      <code>\"how are you?\"</code> But not out of politeness as most people do\n      who never expect or interest themselves in the actual answer. I usually am\n      genuinely interested in what they say :) Especially after the weekend, I\n      am eager to hear those weekend stories, how people spend their life\n      outside of work. But as it happens to be a Monday, the answer to{\" \"}\n      <code>\"how are you?\"</code> is however typically:{\" \"}\n      <code>\"Yeah, you know.. Monday\"</code>.\n      <blockquote>\n        For most work-bound souls, Monday has become an <code>adjective.</code>{\" \"}\n        Monday has become the the <code>state</code> of spirit.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      But when I ask people how they are, it is also for me a small\n      retrospective moment to actually give a brief check on my own emotional\n      state. And what I surprisingly found this particular Monday was that I was\n      actually <code>looking forward</code> to go to job! Just like entire last\n      week. And so unlike so many weeks before. Tracing back to... years even.\n      Wow, what a delightful plot twist. What a peaceful feeling that it{\" \"}\n      <code>is</code> actually possible to like the job and to be (at least for\n      a brief moment in life)... simply <code>content</code>.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The peaceful moment lasted.. for about that lift ride :) As afterwards I\n      tried to make another repo work on my local, following very short guide (5\n      instructions) and failed on the very last one - installing Docker.. I am\n      cursed with this Docker, it keeps resisting my attempts to tame it. Error\n      message was quite clear: <code>Low on disc space</code>.. What was not\n      clear though was... how on EARTH I can run out of disc space after [\"one\",\n      \"ein\", \"um\", \"jeden\"] week of having brand new pc? Aaaanyhow, seems like\n      issue with initial system installation. And... Dom is on holiday. Issue\n      will have to wait till Wednesday. Time for progress on studying\n      Typescript.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Oh and evening was quite interesting. Signed up for a 1 hour meditation\n      workshop on Mindvalley. Was really pleasant to silence the thoughts and\n      enjoy some peace in my own head :)\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZJgxiKI.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Tina Nord from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 6: 10.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        It is happening..

I learned more in one day than\n      in previous 1.5 weeks. Wohaa. And I was such a good apprentice, so bright\n      and fast-learner and uncomplicated, that my mentor totally did NOT HAVE TO\n      take his laptop and move to a table right next to me, so that he doesn't\n      need to walk all way to my place every few seconds when I had another\n      thousand of questions :) Hey, at least I had a neighbour!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And as all my new colleagues are so nice to me and help me out, I decided\n      to purchase a special treat for them.\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/al6QpWq.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />I\n      called it a <s>bribe</s>.. thank-you package :)\n      <br />\n      - the 1st one for the 1st colleagues\n      <br />- the 2nd one for <s>the 2nd coll</s>.. ok, for ME.\n      <br />\n      - the rest of them, yes, for ME as well :)\n      <br />\n      One of them was already missing in the picture (that was the first one..)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The afternoon was rather confusing.

And as the company\n      announced yesterday that we all would be taking home office from next\n      Monday on and after agreement with my own boss to be able to already start\n      my home office tomorrow, I was packed with my laptop, with a huge bag with\n      all my stuff from the fridge. And seeing all other people also rushing to\n      the Bratislava train with also huge bags and some of them even with their{\" \"}\n      <code>monitors</code>... it totally felt like an...{\" \"}\n      <code>evacuation</code>. Which I guess it actually <strong>was</strong>.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Brrr... spooky train ride back home.

I try to focus on my job, but it just\n      feels strange. Kind of out of this space.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Ok, decision has been made, emergency shopping (just to be on the safe\n      side and prepared for any eventuality [of an apocalypse]):\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/F3JevVz.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      Now whatever happens, I will be fine (dose of chocolate solves every\n      problem in the world, does it not?).\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And I made a tough decision today. I was considering to travel to my\n      family in the evening or not. As tempting as it was (even having a\n      colleague who would give me a ride), I decided against it. After all I\n      have been in Vienna for past weeks where situation is much more severe\n      than in Slovakia and where I have been exposed to lots and lots of people\n      in trains, U-bahn, job, outside of job.. Which increases probability of\n      potential danger even if I do not have any symptoms. So it would not be\n      wise and responsible now to pose the same risk to my family. As much as I\n      miss them, they and their health are much more important to me than my\n      loneliness.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Anyway, today I did some QA testing for the issue implemented by my\n      colleague and then I literally spent entire day (until midnight) browsing\n      the code, playing around, testing some of my hypothesis and trying to\n      figure things out. You can tell that it was very interesting that it kept\n      me awake for so long. And I think to invest some of my private time now\n      into discovering things on my own could make a difference in long run. And\n      especially when it actually makes <code>fun</code> :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And here is my <code>home office</code> setup:\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LE1F5XE.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 10: 16.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      Feels weird when you know that entire crew is working from home office\n      today (and who knows how long) due to the emergency situation with the\n      Corona virus. Everyone is worried and starts to take the quarantine\n      seriously. You find it difficult to actually think about work as at the\n      back of your head the whole situation (which feel absurd) plays on repeat.\n      And you feel so remote, so alone, so detached from everything and\n      everyone. And then suddenly you receive a slack message from a colleague:\n      <blockquote>\n        \"Good morning! Just don't want to lose the habits of the normal life\"{\" \"}\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Yes, one must love their colleagues :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Apart from everything, today I was really motivated to make some{\" \"}\n      <code>serious</code> progress on my <code>very first </code> \n      issue. Especially because I had been planning to work on it during the\n      weekend, which... somehow... not sure how... actually did <code>not</code> happen :) So\n      I decided to make up for it today! And.. I failed.. miserably.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      I kinda knew there will be times which will be tough and when I will feel\n      stuck. But.. did they have to come, like.. <code>already</code>? Do they need to come\n      like.. <code>every 10 minutes</code>? :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Luckily my mentor is a very patient man. But even him after 50 minutes\n      call trying to actually explain to me what is expected from me in the\n      issue, even he pointed out that he hopes that now I understand since he\n      already spent 50 minutes on me :) Yes, well... hmm... felt humbling, but\n      come on, I need to understand what I should do before I can even start,\n      right? RIGHT?\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The evening was very pleasant! Spent it playing Age of Empires II online with\n      a friend! And of course we won! :) It could not have been any other way, we are pros!   And at least for a brief moment it did\n      not feel so lonely in this apartment. It alomst felt.... normal again.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Afterwards I decided to still browse some code, explore things on my own,\n      so that I do not feel so dumb all the time. And yes, there was a second\n      reason which I did not want to admit to myself that actually was any\n      reason... I was kind of nervous about the whole situation and that I was\n      adviced by a friend to think about making some small stock of food for\n      myself...you know.. just in case. I <code>DO NOT</code> want to admit that\n      I might need stuff for <code>just in case</code>. Because then it really\n      starts to be scary... But at the same time it is rational! But I better do\n      it tomorrow morning right when they open up (which is 6am...gosh). And\n      yes, being nervous is a <code>no-go</code> to sleep for me. So I was awake\n      till 1 am pretending to be working, while just in reality trying to make\n      myself exhausted so that I would fall asleep.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Which I did!\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LE1F5XE.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 11: 17.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>...</blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Waking up early 5:50 to do some shopping for stocks, going to pharmacy and\n      obtaining a white TREASUE (no no, IM not talking about the toilet paper )\n      Im talking about the face mask!

Because I was so happy with my performance. I did a lot of\n      progress on my issue, then also on change requests other team mates made.\n      Plus I even did a code review of an article a colleague wrote. I am\n      usually shy to do code reviews, cause... let's be honest how much relevant\n      input a Junior like me can contribute especially to code of people who are\n      10+ years experienced?
