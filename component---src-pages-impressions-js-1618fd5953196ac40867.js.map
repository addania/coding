But as it happens to be a Monday, the answer to{\" \"}\n      <code>\"how are you?\"</code> is however typically:{\" \"}\n      <code>\"Yeah, you know..

And what I surprisingly found this particular Monday was that I was\n      actually <code>looking forward</code> to go to job! Just like entire last\n      week. And so unlike so many weeks before.

I am cursed with this Docker, it keeps resisting my attempts to tame it. Error message was quite\n      clear: <code>Low on disc space</code>.. What was not clear though was...\n      how on EARTH I can run out of disc space after [one, ein, um, jeden] week\n      of having brand new pc?

And I was such a good apprentice, so bright\n      and fast-learner and uncomplicated, that my mentor totally did NOT HAVE\n      TO take his laptop and move to a table right next to me, so that he\n      doesn't need to walk all way to my place every few seconds when I had\n      another thousand of questions :) Hey, at least I had a neighbour!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      anyway today i felt generous...\n      ...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Side note:\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And today I finally got my bath robe back from ... someone. Yeah, because\n      it is perfectly fine to have people safe-keeping (and because you can\n      never be sure) and/or wearing your bath robes :) Anyhow, it was my\n      favourite bath robe (because it was the only one) and for almost a year\n      it was... away. So now I finally got it back and brought this treasure home.\n      Only I brought it with an uninvited guest. It turned out to be a host of\n      a... <code>Motte</code>!!
