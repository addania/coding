**12.03.2020 - Thursday**

> Today I am dangerous.

All boxes are checked:

<input type="checkbox" checked></input> dangerous sunglasses (as real as
imaginary) are on

<input type="checkbox" checked></input> dangerous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRQwZDWz1Pw">track</a> is on

<input type="checkbox" checked></input> I (dangerously) stir in my chair
to find that perfect subtle (and dangerous) alignment for my dangerous ..
<s>butt</s>.. spine!!

Today I will work on my very first issue and I will solve it, crack it,
nail it.. all on my own! Completely alone!! And then I will obviously rule
the universe.. At least that is the plan.. What can possible stop me? :))
Hmm, maybe I should take a look at that issue first, maybe :))

2 hours later....

Ok, let's not talk about it, just NOT! Hahaha :))

But at least I learned a lot today (more on it
<a href="https://addania.github.io/coding/Template_Literal/">here</a>).
Today my head literally exploded with info. I learned more in one day than
in previous 1.5 weeks. Wohaa. And I was such a good apprentice, so bright
and fast-learner and uncomplicated, that my mentor totally did NOT HAVE TO
take his laptop and move to a table right next to me, so that he doesn't
need to walk all way to my place every few seconds when I had another
thousand of questions :) Hey, at least I had a neighbour!

And as all my new colleagues are so nice to me and help me out, I decided
to purchase a special treat for them.

I called it a <s>bribe</s>.. thank-you package :)

- the 1st one for the 1st colleagues

- the 2nd one for <s>the 2nd coll</s>.. ok, for ME.

- the rest of them, yes, for ME as well :)

One of them was already missing in the picture (that was the first one..)

The afternoon was rather confusing. I really wanted to concentrate on
coding, but as my Slovak colleague was bombarding me with latest
announcements from Slovak government that they are closing borders with
Austria and everyone coming to the country from abroad will be kept in
quaranteen, I was slowly starting to be nervous about being even able to
come home today.

I completely forgot about the German course and we also cancelled
the

</a>
after-work hangout and soon I was rushing to the train station hoping that
the trains to Slovakia would not be cancelled yet (as some trains to Italy
and Switzerland had been already for couple of days). And as the company
announced yesterday that we all would be taking home office from next
Monday on and after agreement with my own boss to be able to already start
my home office tomorrow, I was packed with my laptop, with a huge bag with
all my stuff from the fridge. And seeing all other people also rushing to
the Bratislava train with also huge bags and some of them even with their
`monitors`... it totally felt like an...
`evacuation`. Which I guess it actually <strong>was</strong>.

Brrr... spooky train ride back home. There was such a heavy and somber
atmosphere hanging (even stuck) in the air. Or was it just me?

<i>(on the bright) Side (Note):</i>

Today I finally got my bath robe back from ... someone. Yeah, because it
is perfectly fine to have people safe-keeping (and because you can never
be sure) and/or wearing your bath robes :) Anyhow, it was my favourite
bath robe (because it was the only one) and for almost a year it was...
away. So now I finally got it back and brought this treasure home. Only I
brought it with an uninvited guest. It turned out to be a host of a...
`Motte`!! So annoying, having `Motte` in my home
sweet home, my pristine castle, my holy sanctuary??

...Fast-forward to Saturday...
