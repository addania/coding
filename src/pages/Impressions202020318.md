**18.03.2020 - Wednesday**

> When you wake up and the first thing your consciousness reckognizes is that your head is exploding like fireworks, even after a full night sleep, you know that this is going to be one very very VERY looooooooooong and an utterly miserable day for you...

And the only thing you actually wish for right away is the day to be over.
But guess what... you `need` to work and you have wonderful 8
hours ahead of you where you are expected to deliver and perform! Yay! :)
What is more, being a developer means that those 8 hours will be well
spent staring at the computer screen (which for a migrene is the worst
thing imaginable) and trying to make your `brain` work. Which
already refuses even to think about having the eyes opened. Will be fun
times today.

Usually nothing helps me for the migrane, apart from suffering for 2-3
days and sleeping a lot. Nevertheless, I still gave it a try with 2
anti-migrene pills, the strongest ones I currently had in possession.
Those ones in particular were the best ones I could obtain in London
pharmacy months back when I was in similar migrene emergecy.

Today was the time to test them again. And guess what? A miracle happened!
The migrene stopped in around 2 hours and I was actually able to enjoy the
day and code until 20:40 pm :) And actually, I must say this day was
awesome! Because I was so happy with my performance. I did a lot of
progress on my issue, then also on change requests other team mates made.
Plus I even did a code review of an article a colleague wrote. I am
usually shy to do code reviews, cause... let's be honest how much relevant
input a Junior like me can contribute especially to code of people who are
10+ years experienced? Well, as this was an article about a setup I did
myself last week, I had some tips, omg, I actually had something to{" "}
`say` :) Feels like a queen..ehm, forget queen..
`goddess`!

So yes, today I was satisfied with my work and plenty of things which I
accomplished especially on my (first `real`) issue. It is
really a rewarding feeling when you are heading towards the finishing line
and you see the possibility (far away in the distance still hazy, but
yet...) of a `merge` :) Yes, ok, after the QA testing ofc. But
I already see myself on the winner platform, hugging the imaginary{" "}
`trophy` :)

Speaking of trophies, time to reward myself aaand ZOCKEN ZOCKEN ZOCKEN :))
Hell yes, 2 days ago there was an Ubisoft sale on Steam and I finally
bought Heroes of Might and Magic 5. I had been hunting for this sales for
months now :) Yes, yes, why to pay 10€, when you can only pay 2,5€? I
totally made a saving on this one :)

So bye bye guys, you won't see me in the next couple of hourZ... ok, ok,
actually (due to quarantine) in the next couple of months but at least
there is Internet and there are games :) Time to kill loneliness by being
`totally` (un)productive ;)
