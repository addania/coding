Every day I learn fascinating, mind-blowing things like...

> Rubber Duck!

It does exist! And now I know the most underground knowledge of entire dev universe! Finally, I am part of the gang, I passed the initiation, I am one of them. And now I know about their secret weapon!

You want to know what it is, right? But this knowledge is so sacred, that it can only be passed from Master to the Apprentice after a long and terrifying probe period full of hard work and dedication and ofc things which I swear do not work and then when I show it someone it miraculously works!

Therefore, only priviledged people have access to this knowledge and I
will share it one day with my Apprentice. One day, long long time in
future :))

Have fun googling ;)
