**01.04.2020 - Wednesday**

A typical lazy morning, when you wake up before your alarm clock, letting yourself indulge a bit more snuggled up in the blankets, enjoying time in bed..

...half asleep grabbing the phone to check the time.. and then you jump
out of your bed and out of your skin, when seeing blurily words on Slack from your BOSS saying something like:

> bug.. critical issue.. urgent.. introduced in your PR... @addania & @mentor take a look

ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ¤¯ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±

I am there only for a few weeks, only made couple of PR
contributions and I already managed to break the whole app? ðŸ˜¬ Nightmareof every developer has come to haunt me.

Wow, what an exercise to start the day with a heart attack... only for you to realized it was NOT your PR and actually NOT even the PR of your
mentor. That actually the Big Boss introduced a regression himself while merging our pressious PRs to the main code or whatever black magic he was doing with the code. Phew, that was a close one! I shall live another day!

AaaanywayZ

> I am a proud developer today. I totally nailed it with thorough investigation and in-depth analysis of two issue, wrote extensive task lists, prepared really sophisticated solutions. Took me most of the day, but totally worth it...

...only both issues got `cancelled`. What do you mean
cancelled? Like we are not going to make them? Like when they are almost finished? Like really? Really? After I invested so much effort into this? And seriously `both` of them? Pffff.

No, I don't accept this, I will merge it, let me meeeeeerg..

Noone has ever heard of Addania ever again.. :)

OK, rewind. Maybe I don't merge it. I still like my job.

But the evening was great, had an upper body training with two friends of
mine followed by a very nice conversation :) Yay!
