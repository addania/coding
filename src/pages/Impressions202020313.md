> It starts to be creepy

I mean the whole Corona situation. I try to focus on my job, but it just feels strange. Kind of out of this space.

Ok, decision has been made, emergency shopping (just to be on the safe
side and prepared for any eventuality [of an apocalypse]):

Now whatever happens, I will be fine (dose of chocolate solves every problem in the world, does it not?).

And I made a tough decision today. I was considering to travel to my
family in the evening or not. As tempting as it was (even having a
colleague who would give me a ride), I decided against it. After all I
have been in Vienna for past weeks where situation is much more severe
than in Slovakia and where I have been exposed to lots and lots of people
in trains, U-bahn, job, outside of job.. Which increases probability of
potential danger even if I do not have any symptoms. So it would not be
wise and responsible now to pose the same risk to my family. As much as I
miss them, they and their health are much more important to me than my
loneliness.

Anyway, today I did some QA testing for the issue implemented by my
colleague and then I literally spent entire day (until midnight) browsing
the code, playing around, testing some of my hypothesis and trying to
figure things out. You can tell that it was very interesting that it kept
me awake for so long. And I think to invest some of my private time now
into discovering things on my own could make a difference in long run. And
especially when it actually makes `fun` :)

And here is my `home office` setup:
