If you need a hero, it is Stashing!

Imagine you are working on a projects and it gets really messy. Especially like me when you don't really know what you are doing, but you are doing it anyway :) Test and trial - the best way to hell :) 

Anyhow, things get ugly and you do not really want to make any evidence of it, denial - the ultimate way to pretend it was NOT you who messed up everything :) So, you say, no, not gonna commit, no way on Earth will make me do that. But you need to go back in time and see what there was before (cause obviously you deleted everything, before you could at least give it a try to understand it first) or you need to switch branches. You think, I am screwed! So totally screwed..

And that is exactly the time when your personal saviour comes to play! Stash - the hero of the day! Better remember that name, learn it by heart, so that you can recite it in the middle of the night:

```
git stash
```

Will save all your shi... shiny code... without commiting :) And then you can see anything there was before your higly dangerous business, or you can switch branches at will. And when you are done and bored with old stuff, you get back to your lab experiment code with:
```
git stash pop
```

And there you are :) Back where you left off and back in the black hole. Good luck with that!
