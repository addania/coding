**27.04.2020 - Monday**

You know you have not exactly fasted during the weekend when you wake up on Monday morning still too full to eat breakfast :) And especially if you NEVER EVER under no corcumstances skip breakfast! 

I must admit the weekend was a hobbit feast worth! We did not only have totally home-made yeast `lievance` with double as thick layer of cranberries jam on top of them, not only home-made yeast self-baked crunchy and at the same time soft like feather `bread`, not even only the most amazing home-made love prepared 4 hours cooked `chicken healing soup` that is so yellow it can blind you like a sun... but also `BUCHTY` with powidl marmelade ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥°ðŸ¥° like from a grand-ma... Heaven, I was in Heaven. What can feel better than being home?

Weekened of eating, digesting and more eating... being cozily lazy and not feeling guilty about it. 

And then Monday feels like weekend will never be forgotten. But there are times when you have to step down from the cloud and do some... coding :) Yay! Today I was looking forward to redesign completely a popover and make it ... pretty :)

And to make things even better, had an amazing spontaneous hand stand session! :) Was really great, powerful and accompanied by a nice conversation with a friend. 

Makes me thinking that as soon as this quarantine is over I should really go for a hand stand session with Ulrik. 

And the evil plan was born :)
