**05.03.2020 - Thursday**

> To keep up with the `food` pattern from the past posts (because it makes total sense for a programming blog) I am meeting my former team for our AM / Dev Team lunch today. I miss my team especially because I hired most of them personally and `cherry`-picked almost each and every one of them :) Hmm, cherries... reminds me that I am hungry.

Makes me wonder why I am actually writing a dev blog instead of a food
blog? :) Yeah, because dunno.. why not? :D

Everyone tries to be cool and writes a dev blog and guess what? You find
`dev` stuff for `dev` people in there..
`dev` boring.. ;) Buuut imagine a person who lures you into a
programming blog only for you to find a `golden grail` full of
chocolate and cake and food and did I mention chocolate? :) Surpriiise,
you are in Heaven ! Haha, I am special (or differently talented).

So what is up in the dev world today? Did lots of `VIP` stuff
(a.k.a. very important push). I wrote a major article about the initial
Front-End settup for any future new starter in the company, such a
charitable work :) I am literally a saint already.

And the `hallmark` of the day was plotting with colleagues how
to take over the world using robots :D Oh yes, we founded a
`secret` group of underground `hackers` called
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Tj5BBW9tM">
Team Alpha-Super-Awesome-Cool-Dynamite-Wolf-Squadron
</a>
who will be meeting up after work every week and plotting terrible things.
The very first meeting was .. how to put it.. most interesting. We had..
hmm.. most interesting ideas which included gloves, VR and toilet sensors
:D .. Told ya, most interesting.
