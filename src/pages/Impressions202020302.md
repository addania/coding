**02.03.2020 - Monday**

> The day to be remembered... My very very `1st` day as a Front-End Developer... The day `0`, since obviously all acceptably decent indices shall start with zero.

A day a bit chaotic as I was settling in my new corner of the office.

But a day with a `MohnKuchen` which propheted an excellent day.
After all, what can go wrong when you have a prospect of a delicious cake
and warm cup of tea from our CTO (Chief Tea Officer) to combat literally
ANY challenge in life? They say `piece of cake` for a reason,
don't they? :)
 
A day when I <i>actually</i> talked to <i>actual</i> developers. And
they <i> actually</i> talked BACK :) Thank you `MohnKuchen` ;)
 
A day with `muscle tomcat`. Yes, yes, dear Austrians: ein
Tag mit Muskelkater :) from previous day(s) of intense training and ...
let's admit it... carrying that `MohnKuchen` all the way to the
office.
 
A day deeply satisfying as I finally achieved my long desired goal.
The hard work for past months has finally paid off. Dream turning
inevitably into reality right in front of my eyes. It seems a bit surreal,
it seems a bit... well plain even, earthy maybe. But `MINE`.
 
A day with a small `victory` to setup my first
professional dev environment.
 
A day which ended up with an intriguing `puzzle` to look
forward to solving the next day :)
 
A day with an after-work `hangout` which turned out to be
more pleasant than expected.
 
<blockquote>Total score: The day freaking ROCKED :)</blockquote>
 
And yes, the `cake` was the most important part of it :)
