At first let us take a look at what React Bootstrap is and how it differs from Bootstrap:

**React bootstrap** provides components like Row, Col, etc. They are useful to create a grid layout.

**Bootstrap** provides CSS for styling your data.

> Open your command line

> Go to your project directory and then install React Bootstrap (delivers COMPONENTS like Col, Row) and Bootstrap itself (CSS)
```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

> As React Bootstrap doesn't ship explicitly with CSS we need to import them to our index.js or app.js
```
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```
