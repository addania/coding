> “You should name a variable using the same care with which you name a first-born child.”

Robert C. Martin

Name of each variable, function or component should be chosen with care. There are couple of possible casing conventions:

- camelCase
- PascalCase
- snake_case
- kebab-case


We could use <code>camelCase</code> for example for variables, functions or keys in the object.

<code>PascalCase</code> is often usd for components and for types in Typescript.

<code>kebab-case</code> might be a good choice for naming branches
