We can,t comment out JSX (because // or /* are only valid for Javascript). So if we wanted to comment out this:
``` 
/*<p>
   <code>Welcome</code> to my page.
  </p>*/

 ```

It will not work. We need to wrap the <code>```<p>```</code> tag in curly brackets.
```
{/*
  <p>
   <code>Welcome</code> to my page.
  </p>*/}
```
Now we can finally comment out stuff :) Happy commenting!
