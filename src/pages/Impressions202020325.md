> Holy Mother of All Code!!

I made it work! The modal - the curse of my life! I made it work! How? No clue (ok, maybe a slight clue, or couple of clueS from my mentor)!

Just.. don't ask me to do this again.. like `never` again! Who
needs modals.. anyway? Everyone hates modals.. anyway. Or at least me
since 2 days :) And a small victory will not distract me from the path of hatred laid out so clearly in front of me :)

Anyhow, I implemented one, exactly `one` tiny lil innocent hack
to the code. Tiny lil spy, my personal Addania touch, my signature code..

They discovered..

They didn't approve..

They removed it..

Horrendous crime!

What was it? Glad you `asked` :) I implemented this:
`+` Yes, you see it right: a plus!

Why? Glad you `asked` again :) I needed to convert an index
which was a string to a number. And I did it in suuuuuch an incredibly
clever way.. (self-pat on the shoulder): `+index`

It was sooo clever that even my mentor did not know it and he was asking me: "What is that plus sign doing there?" My pride shone from the Earth to the end of the Universe and then back again.. and then 1 second later he asked me to remove it.. Pffff! He asked me to use Number(index).. How lame, how mainstream! So there goes my signature. But I will not give up, I will smuggle it there one day, when nobody is watching ðŸ˜ˆ muhahahaha
