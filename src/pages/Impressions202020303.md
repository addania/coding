**03.03.2020 - Tuesday**

> First things first... yes, leftovers from the `cake` are still in the fridge.. will be another great day :)

And now back to the `puzzle` from yesterday: how to hack the
unhackable login to the app on my LOCAL? My wildly lucky guess
`admin admin` did not work. But I got an insider tip that the
second half of the riddle I have solved already, muhahahaha. So now only
to get the first one right.

Tadaaa! Mission accomplished! Addania +1 Hacker Skills. It is only my
second day and I am totally pro already :)) ..._cough cough_

Another achievement of the day: I made my very first
`code review` today ðŸ˜Ž It was extremely serious change request:
correct a typo, haha. One must always start somewhere :) Tough life of
beginners.

And I finally finished setup for the main app thanks to couple of (4)
people who helped me make it work after we realized that our internal wiki
is outdated and there are some backend issues.

And the highlight of the day was
`New Starters After-Work Pizza`. Technically I am not a new
starter in the company, however I am new starter in the dev team, so I
joined the event and it was hilarious to talk to my new team. They are
simply amazing and super funny. I love those dev jokes. I didn't want to
leave as I was having lots of fun, but the time was running short for my
Tuesday's Sports Group. It would suck if the teacher didn't arrive :)) So
I had to. And the yoga class was actually nice, relaxing, yet challenging.
Cause without a challenge it would be boring ;)
