**11.03.2020 - Wednesday**

> Great stuff is happening today! I got assigned to my very first `pod`, yay! Moreover, they already gave me the very first ` issue` to look at.

And that is not all :) ! Colleague and I finally re-partitioned the disc
to have enough space for all upcoming devilish projects and for.. Docker
(gosh why I keep mistyping the Docker with `i`). Docker beware!
Here I come again! Full firepower this time! And this time I defeat you!
And so did I... almost...technically... or at least in theory. Cause...
`ANOTHER` error! So I summoned the Docker Wizard Jan :) and we
spent entire afternoon figuring it out. Only it turned out it was not the
Docker issue.

It turned out the `npm start` was completely broken for entire
frontend team. Then I am thinking ... why NOBODY screamed before? I guess
the dev world was waiting for a `hero` to save them.. :) cough*
cough* (oh no... hero with Corona?)!

And yes, today was a big day when I finalized my pro master hipster setup:

Finally 2 huge screens plus the one from laptop. No more compromises with
1 tiny little screen where I try to cramp 6 small windows next to each
other. It is time to live in the lap of luxury, where each window has its
dedicated section! No more `alt-tabing` endlessly in the
`inception` of windows. Dream of every programmer has become
real\*

one. The rest two are decorations" :)* </p>

Worth mentioning is also my pro master hipster
`water --> tea --> coffee` setup (from left to right). Just in case
you haven't noticed :)
