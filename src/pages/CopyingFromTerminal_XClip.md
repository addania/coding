When you need to copy something from the terminal, instead of selecting it manually you can install xclip:

sudo apt-get install xclip

And then use it like this: 
```
<your command> | xclip
```
Example:
```
docker logs adverity-insights | xclip
```
It will copy that commands output to clipboard
