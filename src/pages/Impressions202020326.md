**26.03.2020 - Thursday**

> Now we are talking! A colleague announced a company-wide push-up challenge!

Ow, yes baby. Let's do this! Rules? Post one video a day of yourself doing push-ups, each push-up equals one point. At the end we see score-board of who is winning.

Nice, challenge accepted! And of course as everyone was doing either
normal push-ups or ladies push-ups, I decided to be a black sheep and I
did narrow ones :) I did 21, just to beat the guy who announced the
competition ðŸ˜ˆ Was fun!

Apart from that, today evening was supposed to be an official deployment of the new UI and my PR was still not ready! I mean it would have been finished from my side, only if it wasn't for my lovely colleageus, who requested 1 billion of changes.. even at 9 pm at night.. Well, as I was so dedicated to really make it on time today, I worked till 11 or 12 pm to make it happen..

It did not happen.. as I still needed some feedback from colleagues, final approval and QA testing. There goes my beautiful PR being part of the first major deployment.. at least since I'm in dev team - which means since 2,5 weeks :)

Ok, so I decided that the `next` deployment will be the
`major` and the `most important` deployment. And I
will make it to `that` one :)
