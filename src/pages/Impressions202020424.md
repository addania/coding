**24.04.2020 - Friday**

Finally finished Admin pages after horrible battle with a logo upload bug... which it finally turned out that was `not` caused by my PR. Weeee! I did not screw things up ... quite yet :) Opportunity next time!

And I had a pleasant surprise today. A colleague of mine called and wanted to set up a bike trip for the weekend. Wow, nice! When you say bike... I  cannot say no :)
