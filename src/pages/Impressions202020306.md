**06.03.2020 - Friday**

> Emergency! There is:

- no cake
- no funny Italian cooking
- no team lunch
- no choxolate

What is only going to happen?

Oh, wait! It is `Friday`! Nothing (else) matters as long as it is Friday :) It is a good day by `default`.

const [day, setDay] = useState("good");

And therefore this was a (good) day to finally make progress on improving
my `challenge`. Even though it was tempting to still continue
with the handbook, priorities (self-imposed and self-enforced) were clear:
`"Challenge or nothing!"`. Althought Friday was whispering:
"Pick nothing, pick nothing! Nothing is c-h-ool". But I manged some improvements which were IMMEDIATELY approved. Like really? Before I was
waiting for feedback sometimes for 3 weeks. Now it took like 3 minutes.
Power of Friday I guess :)

After-work afternoon and evening were `EPIC`:

- amazing company

- quality conversation

- Magic

- lots of fun while dancing because `Some like it Hot`

- fantastic dinner in the fairyland of Peter Pan

What more to wish? Soles of my feet burnt from dancing: L.I.T.E.R.A.L.L.Y.

This day was `LEGEN..wait for it..DARY`
