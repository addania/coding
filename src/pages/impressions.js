      <strong>Dev day 0: 02.03.2020</strong>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        The day to be remembered... My very very <code>1st </code>
        day as a Front-End Developer... The day <code>0</code>, since obviously
        all acceptably decent indices shall start with zero.
      </blockquote>
      <br />A day a bit chaotic as I was settling in my new corner of the
      office.
      <br />
      <br />
      But a day with a <code>MohnKuchen</code> which propheted an excellent day.
      After all, what can go wrong when you have a prospect of a delicious cake
      and warm cup of tea from our CTO (Chief Tea Officer) to combat literally
      ANY challenge in life? They say <code>piece of cake</code> for a reason,
      don't they? :)
      <br />
      <br />A day when I <i>actually</i> talked to <i>actual</i> developers. And
      they
      <i> actually</i> talked BACK :) Thank you <code>MohnKuchen</code> ;)
      <br />
      <br />A day with <code>muscle tomcat</code>. Yes, yes, dear Austrians: ein
      Tag mit Muskelkater :) from previous day(s) of intense training and ...
      let's admit it... carrying that <code>MohnKuchen</code> all the way to the
      office.
      <br />
      <br />A day deeply satisfying as I finally achieved my long desired goal.
      The hard work for past months has finally paid off. Dream turning
      inevitably into reality right in front of my eyes. It seems a bit surreal,
      it seems a bit... well plain even, earthy maybe. But <code>MINE</code>.
      <br />
      <br />A day with a small <code>victory</code> to setup my first
      professional dev environment.
      <br />
      <br />A day which ended up with an intriguing <code>puzzle</code> to look
      forward to solving the next day :)
      <br />
      <br />A day with an after-work <code>hangout</code> which turned out to be
      more pleasant than expected.
      <br />
      <blockquote>Total score: The day freaking ROCKED :)</blockquote>
      <br />
      And yes, the <code>cake</code> was the most important part of it :)
      <br />

      <strong>Dev day 0.5: 02/03.03.2020 23:50</strong>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        I just had this philosophical and self-critical moment wondering if this diary had any added value (or speaking language of business: ROI increase) whatsoever. I do not know if for you dear reader(s) (assuming there are any readers... but according to my sophisticated calculations and AI based predictions, there should be precisely at least one: future me), but for me personally it certainly makes LOTS of fun. Especially at these most creative moments at 23:50 [like RIGHT NOW] when I should have been fast asleep like two hours ago and instead I am totally hyped with a waterfall of ideas :))
      </blockquote>
      Anyhow, one simple blog = one happier developer on Earth.

      <strong>Dev day 1: 03.03.2020</strong>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        First things first... yes, leftovers from the <code>cake </code>
        are still in the fridge... will be another great day :)
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      And now back to the <code>puzzle</code> from yesterday: how to hack the
      unhackable login to the app on my LOCAL? My wildly lucky guess{" "}
      <code>admin admin</code> did not work. But I got an insider tip that the
      second half of the riddle I have solved already, muhahahaha. So now only
      to get the first one right.
      <br />
      <br />
      Tadaaa! Mission accomplished! Addania +1 Hacker Skills. It is only my
      second day and I am totally pro already :)) ...*cough cough*
      <br />
      <br />
      Another achievement of the day: I made my very first{" "}
      <code>code review</code> today B) It was extremely serious change request:
      correct a typo, haha. One must always start somewhere :) Tough life of
      beginners.
      <br />
      <br />
      And I finally finished setup for the main app thanks to couple of (4)
      people who helped me make it work after we realized that our internal wiki
      is outdated and there are some backend issues.
      <br />
      <br />
      And the highlight of the day was{" "}
      <code>New Starters After-Work Pizza</code>. Technically I am not a new
      starter in the company, however I am new starter in the dev team, so I
      joined the event and it was hilarious to talk to my new team. They are
      simply amazing and super funny. I love those dev jokes. I didn't want to
      leave as I was having lots of fun, but the time was running short for my
      Tuesday's Sports Group. It would suck if the teacher didn't arrive :)) So
      I had to. And the yoga class was actually nice, relaxing, yet challenging.
      Cause without a challenge it would be boring ;)

      <strong>Dev day 2: 04.03.2020</strong>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        Excellent, I got an Italian cooking Italian lunch for me today. Life
        cannot be better :) I hope he uses enough of his <code>Pepper</code> to
        make me giggle whole day. Cheers Giulio!
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      Motto of the day: Feed developer, save the world.
      <br />
      const developer = "addania"
      <br />
      <br />
      Plus as a bonus I got not only 1 (one) achievement, but actually 3 (THREE)
      :) I managed to create my very first PR and as <code> all good things come in
      threes</code> I also sumbitted the second and the third. All got approved and merged,
      yay!
      <br />
      <br />
      The evening was painfully funny. Or.. painful & funny? Or both at the same
      time? Only I know... and him.

      <strong>Dev day 3: 05.03.2020</strong>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        To keep up with the <code>food</code> pattern from the past posts (because it makes total sense for a programming blog) I am meeting my former team for our AM / Dev Team lunch today. I miss my team especially because I hired most of them personally and <code>cherry</code>-picked almost each and every one of them :) Hmm, cherries... reminds me that I am hungry.
      </blockquote>
      <br />
      Makes me wonder why I am actually writing a dev blog instead of a food blog? :) Yeah, because dunno.. why not? :D
      <br />
      <br />
      Everyone tries to be cool and writes a dev blog and guess what? You find <code>dev</code> stuff for <code>dev</code> people in there.. <code>dev</code> boring.. ;) Buuut imagine a person who lures you into a programming blog only for you to find a <code>golden grail</code> full of chocolate and cake and food and did I mention chocolate? :) Surpriiise, you are in Heaven ! Haha, I am special (or differently talented).
      <br />
      <br />
      So what is up in the dev world today? Did lots of <code>VIP</code> stuff (a.k.a. very important push). I wrote a major article about the initial Front-End settup for any future new starter in the company, such a charitable work :) I am literally a saint already.
      <br />
      <br />
      And the <code>hallmark</code> of the day was plotting with colleagues how to take over the world using robots :D Oh yes, we founded a <code>secret</code> group of underground <code>hackers</code> called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Tj5BBW9tM">Team Alpha-Super-Awesome-Cool-Dynamite-Wolf-Squadron</a> who will be meeting up after work every week and plotting terrible things. The very first meeting was .. how to put it.. most interesting. We had.. hmm.. most interesting ideas which included gloves, VR and toilet sensors :D .. Told ya, most interesting.

      <strong>Dev day 4: 06.03.2020</strong>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        Emergency! There is:
        <br />
        - no cake
        <br />
        - no funny Italian cooking
        <br />
        - no team lunch
        <br />
        - no choxolate
    </blockquote>
      <br />
      What is only going to happen?
      <br />
      <br />
      Oh, wait! It is <code>Friday</code>! Nothing (else) matters as long as it is Friday :) It is a good day by <code>default</code>.
      <br />
      <br />
      const [day, setDay] = useState("good");
      <br />
      <br />
      And therefore this was a (good) day to finally make progress on improving my <code>challenge</code>. Even though it was tempting to still continue with the handbook, priorities (self-imposed and self-enforced) were clear: <code>"Challenge or nothing!"</code>. Althought Friday was whispering: "Pick nothing, pick nothing! Nothing is c-h-ool". But I manged some improvements which were IMMEDIATELY approved. Like really? Before I was waiting for feedback sometimes for 3 weeks. Now it took like 3 minutes. Power of Friday I guess :)
      <br />
      <br />
      After-work afternoon and evening were <code>EPIC</code>:
      <br />
      <br />
      - amazing company
      <br />
      - quality conversation
      <br />
      - Magic
      <br />
      - lots of fun while dancing because <code>Some like it Hot</code>
      <br />
      - fantastic dinner in the fairyland of Peter Pan
	    <br />
      <br />
      What more to wish? Soles of my feet burnt from dancing: L.I.T.E.R.A.L.L.Y.
	    <br />
      <br />
      This day was <code>LEGEN..wait for it..DARY</code>

      <strong>Dev day 5: 09.03.2020</strong>
      <br />
      <blockquote>
        You know how those <code>lift conversations</code> go.. You have <code>30 seconds</code> to engage your fellow travellers (who happen to be your colleagues) in a very serious conversation about very serious topics like weather and stuff :) As I find weather topic boring,, I usually ask "how are you?" But not out of politeness as most people do who never expect or interest themselves in the actual answer. I usually am genuinly interested in the answer :) Especially after the weekend, I am eager to hear those weekend stories, how people spend their life outside of work. But as it happens to be a Monday, the answer to "how are you?" is however typically: "yeah, you know.. Monday". For most work-bound souls, Monday has become an adjective. Monday has become the the state of spirit.
    </blockquote>
      <br />
      <br />
    But when I ask people how they are, it is also for me a small retrospective moment to actually give a brief check on my own emotional state. And what I surprisingly found this particular Monday was that I was actually `looking forward` to go to job! Just like entire last week. And so unlike so many many weeks before. Tracing back to... years even. Wow, what a delightful plot twist. What a peaceful feeling that it `is` actually possible to like the job and to be (at least for a brief moment in life)... simply `content`.
    <br />
      <br />
    The peaceful moment lasted.. for about that lift ride :) As afterwards I tried to make another repo work on my local, following very short guide (5 instructions) and failed on the very last one. Error message was quite clear: Low on discspace... What was not clear though was... how on EARTH I can run out of disc space after [one, ein, um, jeden] week of having brand new pc? Aaaanyhow, seems like issue with initial system installation. And... Dom is on holiday. Issue will have to wait till Wednesday. Time for progress on studying Typescript.
