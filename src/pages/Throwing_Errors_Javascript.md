Because everyone loves when the app throws an error, right? That is why it is useful to know how to actually throw it :) You grab the error, strain the muscles, grind teeth and throw it as far as possible :))

Anyhow, to log an error in the console <code>use throw new Error</code> and some meaningful description of the error itself:
```
throw new Error('WAAAA');
```
