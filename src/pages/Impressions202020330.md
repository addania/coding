**30.03.2020 - Monday**

> They brought it on, hahaha :)

Interesting how everyone was posting 20 something push-ups before. But
after I posted my 40, people started suddenly posting 50, 60 or
`even` 70 push-ups.. Pff, those lazy bastards needed some real
`push`, hahaha :)

Codewise, today was an `epic` day! I did not only finish my new
PR, I actually finished whole 3 of them. Yes, you hear it, THREE! :) Plus I created I think 6 issues and even reviewed one of my colleague's. I was totally on fire today! Careful, else you get burnt :)

And continuing the fire theme of the day, my friend, his brother and I set some villages on fire :)

In Age of Empires II :) Was a really great day, satisfying, funny, oh and the bonus was a great progress on my handstand! And of course the bonfire.
