The long-expected day has finally arrived when I got my completely brand new baby computer for my new role as Front-End Developer. Thus was the joy when I saw that ligh-weight ThinkPad cutie. Excitement lasted until I tried to copy paste the first thing. You can guess it... <code>IT DID NOT WORK!</code> 

To my horror I realized that <code>FN</code> and <code>STRG/CTRL</code> keys were switched!! Which cruel creature on this planet would ever do that to humanity? I wondered. And wonder soon became frustration. Frustration quickly turned into anger, which then left me browsing internet for a desperate life-saving hack. 

And I found what I was searching for. Solution which was much quicker and easier than I thought.

In order to swap <code>FN</code> and <code>STRG/CTRL</code>, you will need to go to BIOS. In my dual operating system configuration, upon starting the computer I can choose between Ubuntu and Windows or navigate to <code>System Setup</code>. Choose System Setup to start BIOS:

Afterwards go to the <code>Config</code> tab and select <code>Keyboard/Mouse</code> setting.

There enable the <code>Fn and Ctrl Key swap</code>

Then you can click <code>ESC</code> to exit this tab and navigate to <code>Restart</code> tab to select <code>Exit saving changes</code>

You will obviously need to confirm that you want to save the configuration changes.
