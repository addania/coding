**19.03.2020 - Thursday**

> There `is` hope! I see the light at the end of the tunnel

I worked relentlessly on all the change request `torture`
from my mentor and my colleagues. I integrated everything they wanted. And
now, the big time has come to move my issue to QA testing! I am soooo
close to having it merged to the main branch.

And then it happened... an unforgettable conversation between me and my
mentor, so deep and full of love, support, understandting, where he
expressed his undying trust in me and in my work...

Mentor: "I will now test your PR ðŸ˜„ Be prepared ðŸ˜„"

Addania: "I DARE YOU ðŸ˜„"

Addnia: "but you only are allowed to test it the way I described in the `How to test` section ðŸ˜‰"

Addania: "which will purposedly skip all the necessary steps"

Mentor: "the `how to test` is only a guildeline, i will test
every file you touched, directly or indirectly ðŸ˜›"

Addania: "now I am panicking"

Addania: "who cares about Corona, real danger is QA testing!"

Mentor:

Addania: "by the way, the word from thy Emperor:""

> Addania: "one question, how extensive should QA testing reports be?"

Emperor: "not too detailed, as we are doing extensive tests later on.
the `how to test` section is usually a good guideline. for
such an issue, 5 minutes max"

Addania: "there you GO Master! You will have 5 minutes for it, have fun
ðŸ˜„"

Mentor: "i won't need more anyway ðŸ˜„"

One minute later... (when I already thought I got away with it...)

Mentor: "aaand I found something"

Addania: "I'm crying already"

So yeah, that was my day in a nutshell :)

What was interesting as well, was the evening. My sports group decided
that `nothing shall stop us` (not even a wold-wide pandemic,
governmental order for total quarantine, social distancing, closure of
borders.. and other fun stuff) and they organized a virtual training,
haha. Was really great and it felt almost... normal :) Great when the
technology is really enabling people in such difficult times (of [virus]
oppression).

And later on... was simply... and to the deepest sense of it...
B.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L :) Had a wonderful conversation with a friend. Nothing
feels better than spending some quality time with quality people
discussing intriguing things.
