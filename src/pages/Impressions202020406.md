So let me get this straight. We have already around 100 ways to define a function - with word function, with const, arrow functions, functions with return statement, arrows with explicit return, bla bla. Then we also have one trillion itterators. For loops, for in loops, for of loops, foreach, for WHAT NOT? Not to mention all the maps, filters, reducers, and other ugly creatures living their own independent and higly unsettling life... :) Poor developers who need to understand their complicated habits, feed them and nurture them. And especially poor ME...

Now guess what? `Generators`.. You hear it, generators .. another damn way to define another damn function which is kind of a damn interator except it is not :) Your head is already steaming? So is mine.

So yes, this is a new thing I learned today in my programming course. And this is probably another thing I will forget tomorrow :) Luckily my head is forgetful enough to actually do some natural DROP TABLE
brain_memories_of_useless_stuff_and_useless_people :) :) Thank you brain! :)

Brain: "Welcome!"

Haha, this is literally the first time, I let my brain write
something! Or I am just crazy and should go to sleep as it is again almost midnight and my main inspiration is coming at around this time. Cause, why not, brain? :) 

Brain: "Muhahahahaaaaaaaaaaa"
