> tRPC is an open-source framework for building TypeScript APIs. It's a modern alternative to REST APIs and can be used to build APIs for web applications, mobile applications, and other types of software.

> tRPC is for full-stack TypeScript developers. It makes it easy to write endpoints that you can safely use in both the front and backend of your app.

> Its main benefit is that it provides perfect type safety and auto-complete between client (frontend) and the API (backend)

> Condition is: your backend and frontend need to live in the same repository. Obviously you want to use Typescript as the whole purpose is to have backend (server) and frontend (client) type-safe.

> Then if you change something on the backend, it will be automatically picked up on the frontend and warn you via Typescript errors
