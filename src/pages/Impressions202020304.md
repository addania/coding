> Excellent, I got an Italian cooking Italian lunch for me today. Life cannot be better :) I hope he uses enough of his `Pepper` to make me giggle whole day. Cheers Giulio!

Motto of the day: Feed developer, save the world.

const developer = "addania"

Plus as a bonus I got not only 1 (one) achievement, but actually 3 (THREE)
:) I managed to create my very first PR and as
`all good things come in threes` I also sumbitted the second
and the third. All got approved and merged, yay!

The evening was painfully beautiful. Or.. painful & beautiful? Or both at
the same time? Only I know... and him.
