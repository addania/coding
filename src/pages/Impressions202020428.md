**28.04.2020 - Tuesday**

Woke up with a stomach pain... Nah, can't be true. Could still the weekend endulgency be the reason? No, certainly no! :) 

Hot electric pillow on my belly and hot camile tea made wonders. And soon enough I had enough energy to code and rock, rock and code and both at the same time :)

Instead of going for a bike, I decided to take it easy with exercises today and stay at home, lazily lay in bed and watch TV.

Only I got a message from my friend from our sports group asking me if I can substitute her tomorrow on the training. Calm evening is over, need to prepare the session, haha :) This irony. Luckily I enjoy preparing exercises and teaching. So, let's get to it.
