**02/03.03.2020 - Monday_Tuesday 23:50**

> I just had this philosophical and self-critical moment wondering if this diary had any added value whatsoever.

I do not know if for you dear reader(s) (assuming there are any
readers... but according to my sophisticated calculations and AI based
predictions, there should be precisely at least one: future me), so for me
personally it certainly makes `lots` of fun. Especially at
these most creative moments at 23:50 (like `right now`) when I
should have been fast asleep like two hours ago and instead I am totally
hyped with a waterfall of ideas :))

Anyhow, one simple blog = one (sleepless but) happier developer on Earth.
