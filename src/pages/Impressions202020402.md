**02.04.2020 - Thursday**

> To be, or not to be (`a url`), that is the question:

or maybe the question:
<i>"Where the hell can I get that `url` from?"</i> made me busy entire morning. And not only me, because obviously I asked everyone who I dared to bother :) And it was not really an easy one. And the answer was, `of course` it was hiding where I was `already` looking couple of times, but because of my eyes I did not see it. And because of course, why would we call things with their proper names? That would be too easy.. It is way more adventurous to call stuff in puzzles, riddles, foreign languages and poems so that nobody understands..

> O `Stack`, `Stack` wherefore art thou `Stack`?</br>
> Deny thy father and refuse thy `name`.</br>
> Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love</br>
> And I’ll no longer be a `Workspace`.</br>
> ‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy:</br>
> Thou art thyself, though not an `Organization`.</br>
> What’s `Organization`? It is nor hand nor foot</br>
> Nor arm nor face nor any other part </br>
> Belonging to a man. O be some other `name`!!!</br>

And the rest of the day I spent testing. Most importantly I tested an
issue of my friend, which made it special and fun. And then we spent
entire evening talking about it :) Was very nice. And right before going
to bed I did some midnight push-ups, just to keep my score ;)
