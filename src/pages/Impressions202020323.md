**23.03.2020 - Monday**

> Nope! Did not happen... No magical enlightment, no Nirvana. I did not reach higher consciousness over the weekend.

I feel as dumb as I did on Friday (maybe even dumber, as I do not
even remember what I was doing in the code on Friday). Jupiii, will be
hell of a day. Literally ;) Maybe my soul will burn, and `then`
I get enlightened! It would prove that I actually have soul.. now that
would be `interesting`... :)

Anyhow I had to reach out to wisdoms of my mentor to guide me to the point from where I could at least start. The starting point was.... to delete around 10 complex files and do everything from scratch..

Quoting my mentor:

> Yes, remove all custom styles.

I shed a tear and then made some very nice progress with the design
itself. Who care that all the functionality is missing :) The looks is
important, no? Nevertheless, it was fun coding today. Would be a perfect day, if only I did not have to do some annoying `manual` work
for my ex-boss from my previous team. Who does not like filling out a
1000th spreadsheet manually, even though we have the same information
spread across 5 different softwares...? Well in year 2020 manual work
FTW... (or not)...

I decided that rather then raging over it, I wrap it up for today and then
I had a great after-work training with my sports group. Love to get
sweaty!

And now time fooooor... wait for it.... gaming :) Another online
multiplayer appointment is awaiting for me, therefore I better get to it.
I do not want to get my sweet civilization in year 2070 wait for their
ruler :)
