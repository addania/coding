**16.03.2020 - Monday**

Feels weird when you know that entire crew is working from home office
today (and who knows how long) due to the emergency situation with the
Corona virus. Everyone is worried and starts to take the quarantine
seriously. You find it difficult to actually think about work as at the
back of your head the whole situation (which feel absurd) plays on repeat.
And you feel so remote, so alone, so detached from everything and
everyone. And then suddenly you receive a slack message from a colleague:

> "Good morning! Just don't want to lose the habits of the normal life"

Yes, one must love their colleagues :)

Apart from everything, today I was really motivated to make some
`serious` progress on my `very first`
issue. Especially because I had been planning to work on it during the
weekend, which... somehow... not sure how... actually did `not`
happen :) So I decided to make up for it today! And.. I failed..
miserably.

I kinda knew there will be times which will be tough and when I will
feel stuck. But.. did they have to come, like.. `already`? Do
they need to come like.. `every 10 minutes`? :)

Luckily my mentor is a very patient man. But even him after 50 minutes
call trying to actually explain to me what is expected from me in the
issue, even he pointed out that he hopes that now I understand since he
already spent 50 minutes on me :) Yes, well... hmm... felt humbling, but
come on, I need to understand what I should do before I can even start,
right? RIGHT?

The evening was very pleasant! Spent it playing Age of Empires II online
with a friend! And of course we won! :) It could not have been any other
way, we are pros! And at least for a brief moment it did not feel so
lonely in this apartment. It alomst felt.... normal again.

Afterwards I decided to still browse some code, explore things on my own,
so that I do not feel so dumb all the time. And yes, there was a second
reason which I did not want to admit to myself that actually was any
reason... I was kind of nervous about the whole situation and that I was
adviced by a friend to think about making some small stock of food for
myself...you know.. just in case. I `DO NOT` want to admit that
I might need stuff for `just in case`. Because then it really
starts to be scary... But at the same time it is rational! But I better do
it tomorrow morning right when they open up (which is 6am...gosh). And
yes, being nervous is a `no-go` to sleep for me. So I was awake
till 1 am pretending to be working, while just in reality trying to make
myself exhausted so that I would fall asleep.

Which I did!
