**10.03.2020 - Tuesday**

> It is happening.. I cannot believe it..The first real tangible impact of Corona on my life.. React Vienna meetup was `cancelled`!

Was really looking forward to it as it was supposed to be my very first
dev meetup. But it turned out that spontanoues alternative plan was just
as amazing.

Sometimes no matter where you are, what situation surrounds you, if you
are with the right person, the world turns a better place for that brief
moment :) So yeah, cinema, dinner and worthwhile conversation all dosed
just in the perfect balance to flavor the end of the day just right.
