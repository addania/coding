**16.04.2020 - Thursday**

Today (and yesterday), I totally monopolized the QA lane!!! It belongs to me now! No other soul shall ever move their issues with their PRs there! Or at least not without MY permission:)

And as my friend said:

> You are becoming ever present ğŸ˜‰

ğŸ˜ˆğŸ˜ˆğŸ˜ˆ

And today I gave goodbye to my very last two clients. Now I am free :)
Full dev focus! ANnd right away started to work on a bigger project for my boss - complete rehaul of admin pages.

And I went runiiiiiing to the forest by the
sunset after so many months :) Felt incredible! The nature here is magical! I love my secret trails.
