**09.03.2020 - Monday**

You know how those `lift conversations` go.. You have
`30 seconds` to engage your fellow travellers (who happen to be
your colleagues) in a very serious conversation about very serious topics
like weather and stuff :) As I find weather topic boring, I usually ask
`"how are you?"` But not out of politeness as most people do
who never expect or interest themselves in the actual answer. I usually am
genuinely interested in what they say :) Especially after the weekend, I
am eager to hear those weekend stories, how people spend their life
outside of work. But as it happens to be a Monday, the answer to
`"how are you?"` is however typically:
`"Yeah, you know.. Monday"`.

> For most work-bound souls, Monday has become an `adjective.` Monday has become the the `state` of spirit.

But when I ask people how they are, it is also for me a small
retrospective moment to actually give a brief check on my own emotional
state. And what I surprisingly found this particular Monday was that I was
actually `looking forward` to go to job! Just like entire last
week. And so unlike so many weeks before. Tracing back to... years even.
Wow, what a delightful plot twist. What a peaceful feeling that it{" "}
`is` actually possible to like the job and to be (at least for
a brief moment in life)... simply `content`.

The peaceful moment lasted.. for about that lift ride :) As afterwards I
tried to make another repo work on my local, following very short guide (5
instructions) and failed on the very last one - installing Docker.. I am
cursed with this Docker, it keeps resisting my attempts to tame it. Error
message was quite clear: `Low on disc space`.. What was not
clear though was... how on EARTH I can run out of disc space after ["one",
"ein", "um", "jeden"] week of having brand new pc? Aaaanyhow, seems like
issue with initial system installation. And... Dom is on holiday. Issue
will have to wait till Wednesday. Time for progress on studying
Typescript.

Oh and evening was quite interesting. Signed up for a 1 hour meditation
workshop on Mindvalley. Was really pleasant to silence the thoughts and
enjoy some peace in my own head :)
