Each version of the software will be attributed a version tag. There is a convention how the numbers should be assigned. 

In the image above, the version tag consists of 3 numbers: <code>5.2.1</code>:

> <code>Major</code> - for major features which are not backward compatible

> <code>Minor</code> - for new features which aree backward compatible

> <code>Patch</code> - for bug fixes which are also backward compatible

The very first version of the software is usually tagged as: 1.0.0
