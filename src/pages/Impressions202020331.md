**31.03.2020 - Tesday (because who needs "u"? ðŸ˜ƒ )**

> People has gone crazy

..with push-up variations:

- push-ups suited up with a tie,
- push-ups on 3 fingers,
- push-ups with a clap...

I am really impressed! Makes me wonder, what interesting should I come up with?

Ok, to kill em all, I would need my trainer to show them
`THE ULTIMATE FINAL JUDGEMENT`: handstand push-up. But I can't
even do a proper handstand yet, so hmm... ðŸ˜ˆ hmmmmmmmmmm ðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ push-up
with one hand!!! Back in times in my sports aerobics club I could make a few.. Let's see if I still remem... I'M SCREWED!! So totally SCREWED :D hahahaaaa, was a sincere attempt, but unfortunatelly it failed pitifully, or let's just pretend this has never happened. The footage is burnt, destroyed, deleted, burried, anihiliated. Nobody knows.. Nobody `will` know..

Whistle whistle whistle .. maybe let's just go back to normal push-ups.

Coding part of the day was really interesting I learnt more about css,
borders and outlines... out..the WHAT?? What the hell is outline?? Do you mean THE BORDER around stuff like when you focus on something tabing like crazy? It is a border, right? Looks like a border, smells like a border, feels like a border. Then it must be a border! No?

Well.. it turns out that not all borders are borders, some borders are
outlines and all outlines are not borders.. ðŸ¤¯ Dammit..

Message to the future generations: "Don't trust anything that shines like a border... maybe it is just an... outline..." ;)
