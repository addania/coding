**20.03.2020 - Friday**

Drumroll... Drumroll... Drumroll...

Buidling up some tension...

Still... :)

I can hear crowds cheering (from safe government-approved quarantine
distance)...

> My very first `real` PR got merged! Time to celebrate! Time for fireworks! Time for wild `(LAN)` parties! I did it! I hacked the dev universe! Now my signature is in `there`. My spirit will remain in `code`.

Parties and celebrations lasted for maybe half an hour until I began to
work on a new issue. Which started great, because it seemed as a very
similar task to the previous one and I was already starting to feel a bit more comfy and tiny fraction more confident, that I actually start to understand at least a bit of it.

And then I realized what the issue actually `is` about and how
extensive my code re-design is supposed to be. I took a break to cry, eat (whatever) (...ok all of the) sweets I had at home (which by the way was an entire stock of rations for a month time of apocalypse...), then I cried a bit again and afterwards on the recommendation of my mentor I took the second look at it... and even a `bonus` third one... It still looked the same... so I wrapped the working day up and hoped that something magical will happen over the weekend, that on Monday I will wake up and everything will be crystal clear and I simply do it... Let's see...

As a rebellion to that I decided to make progress on meaningful stuff in my life... and played Heroes of Might and Magic 5 until 2 am :) And then I remembered that some time ago someone mentioned to me that humans should actually engage themselves in something called sleep. Fair enough, I should give it a try (from time to time). But before I went I randomly opened an old chat with my skiing group only to find (completely random) meme:

Those coincidences sometimes are `epic`. If only they knew :)
