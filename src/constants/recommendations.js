      "I had the pleasure of working with Mia, and I can wholeheartedly recommend her. She is not only an excellent developer with strong technical skills, but also someone who truly understands that great products go beyond shipping features. Mia takes the time to deeply understand the “why” behind functionality, the real user needs, and the broader user journey. She consistently challenges assumptions and looks for ways to deliver solutions that have real impact for users instead of just ticking boxes. What stands out even more is her leadership and collaboration style. Mia doesn’t shy away from difficult conversations – she actively drives discussions forward, encourages diverse perspectives, and ensures that the team makes decisions that are best for both users and the product. Her ability to combine technical excellence with critical thinking and strong facilitation skills makes her an invaluable asset to any team. I’m confident Mia will be a driving force wherever she goes, and I’m grateful to have had the chance to work alongside her.",

      "I have had a chance to accompany Mia through major career milestones while working together in Adverity. From her associate years until her promotion to the Senior SWE, she has always been truthful to her values of always learning, constantly improving, and being a meticulous leader in project delivery. Having had a chance to manage Mia for quite some time, I am firm that she would be an asset to any team she would be a part of whether by contributing technically or pouring her hard work into transforming business goals into customer value.",
