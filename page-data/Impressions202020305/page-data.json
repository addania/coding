I miss my team especially because I hired most of them personally and <code>cherry</code>-picked almost each and every one of them :) Hmm, cherries... reminds me that I am hungry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Makes me wonder why I am actually writing a dev blog instead of a food\nblog? :) Yeah, because dunno.. why not? :D</p>\n<p>Everyone tries to be cool and writes a dev blog and guess what? You find\n<code>dev</code> stuff for <code>dev</code> people in there..\n<code>dev</code> boring.. ;) Buuut imagine a person who lures you into a\nprogramming blog only for you to find a <code>golden grail</code> full of\nchocolate and cake and food and did I mention chocolate? :) Surpriiise,\nyou are in Heaven ! Haha, I am special (or differently talented).</p>\n<p>So what is up in the dev world today? Did lots of <code>VIP</code> stuff\n(a.k.a. very important push). I wrote a major article about the initial\nFront-End settup for any future new starter in the company, such a\ncharitable work :) I am literally a saint already.</p>\n<p>And the <code>hallmark</code> of the day was plotting with colleagues how\nto take over the world using robots :D Oh yes, we founded a\n<code>secret</code> group of underground <code>hackers</code> called\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Tj5BBW9tM\">\nTeam Alpha-Super-Awesome-Cool-Dynamite-Wolf-Squadron\n</a>\nwho will be meeting up after work every week and plotting terrible things.\nThe very first meeting was .. how to put it.. most interesting. We had..\nhmm.. most interesting ideas which included gloves, VR and toilet sensors\n:D .. Told ya, most interesting.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 3"},"excerpt":"05.03.2020 - Thursday To keep up with the food pattern from the past posts (because it makes total sense for a programming blog) I amâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Impressions202020305/"}}}
