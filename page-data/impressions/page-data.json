(self-pat on the shoulder): <code>+index</code></p>\n<p>It was sooo clever that even my mentor did not know it and he was asking me: \"What is that plus sign doing there?\" My pride shone from the Earth to the end of the Universe and then back again.. and then 1 second later he asked me to remove it..

I certainly do not\nmiss travelling 3 hours a day for job. I can sleep longer and still start my working day earlier than before. Which feels much more productive. Which is certainly great. Also the isolation does not YET feel that horrible. Because with modern technology I do feel connected to people whom I want to be in contact with.

So deving was not as good as I wanted it to be. But as I am still in dual position, torn apart between two departnemnts, I need to grinch my teeth and simply do it. Soon, very soon, I can hand over all my clients and focus 101% on programming, yay!!\n\nAnd today I also started to learn about redux, so that I can make progress on my issue. Wow, found a great tutorial from the author of redux, great stuff... not that great English accent :) I really cannot make myself not mentioning it, hahahaha, as I found it so difficult to understand him from time to time, but overall the tutorial is absolutely awesome, very educative, very insightful! :) So google it, go for it! In case you are interested.\n\nAnd evening was really great! Had an upper body training with my friend. My legs are still crying from the leg training with him on Sunday.
