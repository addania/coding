Hahaha :))</p>\n<p>But at least I learned a lot today (more on it\n<a href=\"https://addania.github.io/coding/Template_Literal/\">here</a>).\nToday my head literally exploded with info. I learned more in one day than\nin previous 1.5 weeks. Wohaa. And I was such a good apprentice, so bright\nand fast-learner and uncomplicated, that my mentor totally did NOT HAVE TO\ntake his laptop and move to a table right next to me, so that he doesn't\nneed to walk all way to my place every few seconds when I had another\nthousand of questions :) Hey, at least I had a neighbour!</p>\n<p>And as all my new colleagues are so nice to me and help me out, I decided\nto purchase a special treat for them.</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/al6QpWq.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n<p>I called it a <s>bribe</s>.. thank-you package :)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the 1st one for the 1st colleagues</li>\n<li>the 2nd one for <s>the 2nd coll</s>.. ok, for ME.</li>\n<li>the rest of them, yes, for ME as well :)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of them was already missing in the picture (that was the first one..)</p>\n<p>The afternoon was rather confusing. I really wanted to concentrate on\ncoding, but as my Slovak colleague was bombarding me with latest\nannouncements from Slovak government that they are closing borders with\nAustria and everyone coming to the country from abroad will be kept in\nquaranteen, I was slowly starting to be nervous about being even able to\ncome home today.</p>\n<p>I completely forgot about the German course and we also cancelled\nthe\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Tj5BBW9tM\">\nTeam Alpha-Super-Awesome-Cool-Dynamite-Wolf-Squadron\n</a>\nafter-work hangout and soon I was rushing to the train station hoping that\nthe trains to Slovakia would not be cancelled yet (as some trains to Italy\nand Switzerland had been already for couple of days). And as the company\nannounced yesterday that we all would be taking home office from next\nMonday on and after agreement with my own boss to be able to already start\nmy home office tomorrow, I was packed with my laptop, with a huge bag with\nall my stuff from the fridge. And seeing all other people also rushing to\nthe Bratislava train with also huge bags and some of them even with their\n<code>monitors</code>... it totally felt like an...\n<code>evacuation</code>. Which I guess it actually <strong>was</strong>.</p>\n<p>Brrr... spooky train ride back home. There was such a heavy and somber\natmosphere hanging (even stuck) in the air. Or was it just me?</p>\n<hr>\n<p><i>(on the bright) Side (Note):</i></p>\n<p>Today I finally got my bath robe back from ... someone. Yeah, because it\nis perfectly fine to have people safe-keeping (and because you can never\nbe sure) and/or wearing your bath robes :) Anyhow, it was my favourite\nbath robe (because it was the only one) and for almost a year it was...\naway. So now I finally got it back and brought this treasure home. Only I\nbrought it with an uninvited guest. It turned out to be a host of a...\n<code>Motte</code>!! So annoying, having <code>Motte</code> in my home\nsweet home, my pristine castle, my holy sanctuary??</p>\n<p>...Fast-forward to Saturday...</p>\n<p>Captain's log, stardate 20200314.18:07:</p>\n<pre style={{ color: \"white\" }} color=\"white\">\n\"After two days of hunting and 10 Mottenfallen: \nHuman versus Motte:\n1:0\"\n</pre>\n<p><img\nsrc=\"https://i.imgur.com/kwERdM2.jpg\"\n alt=\"Photo from https://www.wired.com\"\n/></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 8"},"excerpt":"12.03.2020 - Thursday Today I am dangerous.
