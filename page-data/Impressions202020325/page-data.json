The modal - the curse of my life! I made it work! How? No clue (ok, maybe a slight clue, or couple of clueS from my mentor)!</p>\n<p>Just.. don't ask me to do this again.. like <code>never</code> again! Who\nneeds modals.. anyway? Everyone hates modals.. anyway. Or at least me\nsince 2 days :) And a small victory will not distract me from the path of hatred laid out so clearly in front of me :)</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I implemented one, exactly <code>one</code> tiny lil innocent hack\nto the code. Tiny lil spy, my personal Addania touch, my signature code..</p>\n<p>They discovered..</p>\n<p>They didn't approve..</p>\n<p>They removed it..</p>\n<p>Horrendous crime!</p>\n<p>What was it? Glad you <code>asked</code> :) I implemented this:\n<code>+</code> Yes, you see it right: a plus!</p>\n<p>Why? Glad you <code>asked</code> again :) I needed to convert an index\nwhich was a string to a number. And I did it in suuuuuch an incredibly\nclever way.. (self-pat on the shoulder): <code>+index</code></p>\n<p>It was sooo clever that even my mentor did not know it and he was asking me: \"What is that plus sign doing there?\" My pride shone from the Earth to the end of the Universe and then back again.. and then 1 second later he asked me to remove it.. Pffff! He asked me to use Number(index).. How lame, how mainstream! So there goes my signature. But I will not give up, I will smuggle it there one day, when nobody is watching ðŸ˜ˆ muhahahaha</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WmemWdA.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Negative Space from Pexels\" />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 17"},"excerpt":"25.03.2020 - Wednesday Holy Mother of All Code!!
