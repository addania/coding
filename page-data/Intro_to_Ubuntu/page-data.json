Installation will result in having a completely new operational (sub)system (along side with Windows). When using this Windows Subsystem for Ubuntu, it only allows for command line, it doesnt have any user interface. Only interaction with the operational system is via command line (terminal). This system will be then used with Gatsby to create webpages and push my code to Github. Please note, upon first installation of Ubuntu subsystem, it is a completely blank software. It wont have access to my previously installed programms on Windows (like node.js, etc).
