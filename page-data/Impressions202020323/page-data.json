Jupiii, will be\nhell of a day. Literally ;) Maybe my soul will burn, and <code>then</code>\nI get enlightened! It would prove that I actually have soul.. now that\nwould be <code>interesting</code>... :)</p>\n<p>Anyhow I had to reach out to wisdoms of my mentor to guide me to the point from where I could at least start. The starting point was.... to delete around 10 complex files and do everything from scratch..</p>\n<p>Quoting my mentor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yes, remove all custom styles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bTIkniG.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n<p>I shed a tear and then made some very nice progress with the design\nitself. Who care that all the functionality is missing :) The looks is\nimportant, no? Nevertheless, it was fun coding today. Would be a perfect day, if only I did not have to do some annoying <code>manual</code> work\nfor my ex-boss from my previous team. Who does not like filling out a\n1000th spreadsheet manually, even though we have the same information\nspread across 5 different softwares...? Well in year 2020 manual work\nFTW... (or not)...</p>\n<p>I decided that rather then raging over it, I wrap it up for today and then\nI had a great after-work training with my sports group. Love to get\nsweaty!</p>\n<p>And now time fooooor... wait for it.... gaming :) Another online\nmultiplayer appointment is awaiting for me, therefore I better get to it.\nI do not want to get my sweet civilization in year 2070 wait for their\nruler :)</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dKS2IBs.jpg\" alt=\"Photo from moddb.com\" />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 15"},"excerpt":"23.03.2020 - Monday Nope!
