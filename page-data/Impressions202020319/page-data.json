My sports group decided\nthat <code>nothing shall stop us</code> (not even a wold-wide pandemic,\ngovernmental order for total quarantine, social distancing, closure of\nborders.. and other fun stuff) and they organized a virtual training,\nhaha. Was really great and it felt almost... normal :) Great when the\ntechnology is really enabling people in such difficult times (of [virus]\noppression).</p>\n<p>And later on... was simply... and to the deepest sense of it...\nB.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L :) Had a wonderful conversation with a friend. Nothing\nfeels better than spending some quality time with quality people\ndiscussing intriguing things.</p>\n<p><img\n        src=\"  https://i.imgur.com/rbEzohu.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo from swapwire.com\"\n      /></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 13"},"excerpt":"19.03.2020 - Thursday There is hope!
