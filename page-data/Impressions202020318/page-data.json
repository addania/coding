Yay! :)\nWhat is more, being a developer means that those 8 hours will be well\nspent staring at the computer screen (which for a migrene is the worst\nthing imaginable) and trying to make your <code>brain</code> work. Which\nalready refuses even to think about having the eyes opened. Will be fun\ntimes today.</p>\n<p>Usually nothing helps me for the migrane, apart from suffering for 2-3\ndays and sleeping a lot. Nevertheless, I still gave it a try with 2\nanti-migrene pills, the strongest ones I currently had in possession.\nThose ones in particular were the best ones I could obtain in London\npharmacy months back when I was in similar migrene emergecy.</p>\n<p>Today was the time to test them again. And guess what? A miracle happened!\nThe migrene stopped in around 2 hours and I was actually able to enjoy the\nday and code until 20:40 pm :) And actually, I must say this day was\nawesome! Because I was so happy with my performance. I did a lot of\nprogress on my issue, then also on change requests other team mates made.\nPlus I even did a code review of an article a colleague wrote. I am\nusually shy to do code reviews, cause... let's be honest how much relevant\ninput a Junior like me can contribute especially to code of people who are\n10+ years experienced? Well, as this was an article about a setup I did\nmyself last week, I had some tips, omg, I actually had something to{\" \"}\n<code>say</code> :) Feels like a queen..ehm, forget queen..\n<code>goddess</code>!</p>\n<p>So yes, today I was satisfied with my work and plenty of things which I\naccomplished especially on my (first <code>real</code>) issue. It is\nreally a rewarding feeling when you are heading towards the finishing line\nand you see the possibility (far away in the distance still hazy, but\nyet...) of a <code>merge</code> :) Yes, ok, after the QA testing ofc. But\nI already see myself on the winner platform, hugging the imaginary{\" \"}\n<code>trophy</code> :)</p>\n<p>Speaking of trophies, time to reward myself aaand ZOCKEN ZOCKEN ZOCKEN :))\nHell yes, 2 days ago there was an Ubisoft sale on Steam and I finally\nbought Heroes of Might and Magic 5. I had been hunting for this sales for\nmonths now :) Yes, yes, why to pay 10€, when you can only pay 2,5€? I\ntotally made a saving on this one :)</p>\n<p>So bye bye guys, you won't see me in the next couple of hourZ... ok, ok,\nactually (due to quarantine) in the next couple of months but at least\nthere is Internet and there are games :) Time to kill loneliness by being\n<code>totally</code> (un)productive ;)</p>\n<p><img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/BuwcGWS.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo from wallpaperstock.net\"\n      /></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 12"},"excerpt":"18.03.2020 - Wednesday When you wake up and the first thing your consciousness reckognizes is that your head is exploding like fireworks…"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Impressions202020318/"}}}
