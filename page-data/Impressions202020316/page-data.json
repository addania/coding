Everyone is worried and starts to take the quarantine\nseriously. You find it difficult to actually think about work as at the\nback of your head the whole situation (which feel absurd) plays on repeat.\nAnd you feel so remote, so alone, so detached from everything and\neveryone. And then suddenly you receive a slack message from a colleague:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Good morning! Just don't want to lose the habits of the normal life\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, one must love their colleagues :)</p>\n<p>Apart from everything, today I was really motivated to make some\n<code>serious</code> progress on my <code>very first</code>\nissue. Especially because I had been planning to work on it during the\nweekend, which... somehow... not sure how... actually did <code>not</code>\nhappen :) So I decided to make up for it today! And.. I failed..\nmiserably.</p>\n<p>I kinda knew there will be times which will be tough and when I will\nfeel stuck. But.. did they have to come, like.. <code>already</code>? Do\nthey need to come like.. <code>every 10 minutes</code>? :)</p>\n<p>Luckily my mentor is a very patient man. But even him after 50 minutes\ncall trying to actually explain to me what is expected from me in the\nissue, even he pointed out that he hopes that now I understand since he\nalready spent 50 minutes on me :) Yes, well... hmm... felt humbling, but\ncome on, I need to understand what I should do before I can even start,\nright? RIGHT?</p>\n<p>The evening was very pleasant! Spent it playing Age of Empires II online\nwith a friend! And of course we won! :) It could not have been any other\nway, we are pros! And at least for a brief moment it did not feel so\nlonely in this apartment. It alomst felt.... normal again.</p>\n<p>Afterwards I decided to still browse some code, explore things on my own,\nso that I do not feel so dumb all the time. And yes, there was a second\nreason which I did not want to admit to myself that actually was any\nreason... I was kind of nervous about the whole situation and that I was\nadviced by a friend to think about making some small stock of food for\nmyself...you know.. just in case. I <code>DO NOT</code> want to admit that\nI might need stuff for <code>just in case</code>. Because then it really\nstarts to be scary... But at the same time it is rational! But I better do\nit tomorrow morning right when they open up (which is 6am...gosh). And\nyes, being nervous is a <code>no-go</code> to sleep for me. So I was awake\ntill 1 am pretending to be working, while just in reality trying to make\nmyself exhausted so that I would fall asleep.</p>\n<p>Which I did!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 10"},"excerpt":"16.03.2020 - Monday Feels weird when you know that entire crew is working from home office\ntoday (and who knows how long) due to theâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Impressions202020316/"}}}
