I was struggling to align elements in the interface as I was working on new big project to rewamp entire Admin pages. But then I had a call with my boss and he figured out how some data are provided from the backend! It is great when you have a boos who can ACTUALLY help you! Respect boss! </p>\n<p>So then I could make a really great progress. I love it when I know how to make things pretty :) Sounds superficial, but I really enjoy improving the design of the interface. The only downside is that this work is going sooooo slow. I spent entire evening until 10 pm working on it (ofc with some breaks) and I am still not even in the middle :/ Will take way longer than expected! And I had this thought today that I am the perfect person for the job! I doubt anyone else would be so thorough and have so much patience!! :) Which is a really weird thing. Addania and patience in one sentence? That happens like once a ... NEVER! :) But being a dev, I discover new sides of meee :) So now you shall call me: Addania the patient! Just like in WOW. My first REAL title in REAL life. Self assigned obviously. Counts even more :)</p>\n<p>Aaaand I have another surprise for you. Today I totally did not each chocolate, nor did I drink coffee!! I know, I know! Another thing that happens once a NEVER :))) Day of surprises I guess! Oh, and I also went for a bike.. SURPRIIIISE, ok ok, let's not over do it :) Everyone knows I cannot resist NOT going biking when it is such a beautiful weather outside. My meadows and forests are calling meeeeee! </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 34"},"excerpt":"20.04.2020 - Monday Working day started slowly.
