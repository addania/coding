But\nthen I think again and I trully believe that we can always find something beautiful in each day. And if I fail to find it, it feels like I kind of dont deserve this gift that was give to me called life. Sooo as obviously I DO deserve it, then let me find something amazing about this day! Hmm, hmm, what makes it unique? Oh, hell yes, today, I did not eat sweets! You don't believe it, I know, I dont believe myself either (cause actually I just realized that I had like 3 pieces of 99% chocolate, damn, and I almost got this one. BUT look, achivement of this day is that my mum came to me while I was working and wanted to cheer me up and offered me a regular chocolate. And I RESISTED the temptation, which means Im literally an emobiment of a will of steel! :D :D :D I can control my mind, my body, I'm an Ironman, I mean Iron woman! SPARTAAAA /Flex flex Now thinking about\nflexing, I have sore muscles from yesterdays upper body work out which I enjoy. Having slight pain means I DID work out well enough, so I am\nsatisfied. Plus today I did unexpected HIIT training with a friend. It was great because it was SPONTANEOUS and I like spontaneous, especially when days seem to differ very slightly for menowadays. Work-wise I handed over half of my remaining clients to a new starter. Wee, that definitely is an achievement, as I'm slowly making progress to full dev position. Plus I did some testing where I discovered I think 3-4 bugs or improvement possibilites of the app. Nothing can escape my eagle eye!! Nobody needs to know that those were completely unrelated to the PRs which I was suppose to test and that I wasted probably 1 hours instead of 15 minutes doing the tests. :D And my PR which I worked on, I did some nice progress and solved many issues on my own. Ok, still some are remaining, but that is for another day - another ME :) See, actually when you starts to really give it an effort and think about your actual day and mini schievements, you can always find some and sometimes many! It is not that hard, it is just a mindset. Great, now I am happy with myself. Can go to sleep :) After finishing my (5) programming courses (of course only because i want to win an unofficial competition with my friend). I dont even know honestly what the competition is about - maybe who finishes it first? haaha, no clue, but the challenge is on. And he doesnt even know about it, hahahahaa, Or he maybe suspects something.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 27"},"excerpt":"08.04.2020 - Wednesday When days start to pass in similar manner and the pattern starts to be\nmonotonous, I am not as motivated to write myâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Impressions202020408/"}}}
