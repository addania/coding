CCC.</p>\n<p>So, I tucked my sleeves and I made some research on my own. And you know how it is, when investigating completely on your own something you have no clue about. It feels like on an entirely new planet full of dangerous carnivorous and most importantly hungry animals, where every step is a mine-field. And then soon it can really become quite frustrating when after 3-4 hours you are still at the beginning but having at least some kind of a really vague idea of ... well, stuff.</p>\n<p>But then had a call with my boss. It turned out that I had been on a very good way to solving the issue, I had identified almost every file and part which I needed to amend. And why it was not entirely working was only because I needed to run npm start again to see the changes. Wow, that is cool. That means I did lots on my own. And then he explained many things and I could made a great progress afterwards!</p>\n<p>Evening was great, had an upper body trainign with friends where I was\ngiving my 120% (because I was feeling guilty after eating SO MUCH\nchocolate today - you remember those carnivorous hungry animals, I\nmentioned earlier?... they are to blame... they like chocolate too, they MADE ME!). Then I played some nice board game session with my mum. And afterwards my friend (kind of) challenged me to make some progress on the \"executeprogram\" course boasting with his 70% progress on some courses. Ok, fine! Challenge accepted. Sorry, no time for writing anything more, need to catch up with him :)</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/b9sU97f.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Susanne Jutzeler from Pexels\" />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 26"},"excerpt":"07.04.2020 - (second) Monday, yes yes Today was a confusing day as I was working on webcomponets.
