Thus was the joy when I saw that ligh-weight ThinkPad cutie. Excitement lasted until I tried to copy paste the first thing. You can guess it... <code>IT DID NOT WORK!</code></p>\n<p>To my horror I realized that <code>FN</code> and <code>STRG/CTRL</code> keys were switched!! Which cruel creature on this planet would ever do that to humanity? I wondered. And wonder soon became frustration. Frustration quickly turned into anger, which then left me browsing internet for a desperate life-saving hack.</p>\n<p>And I found what I was searching for. Solution which was much quicker and easier than I thought.</p>\n<p>In order to swap <code>FN</code> and <code>STRG/CTRL</code>, you will need to go to BIOS. In my dual operating system configuration, upon starting the computer I can choose between Ubuntu and Windows or navigate to <code>System Setup</code>. Choose System Setup to start BIOS:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fYkEih0.jpg\" title=\"Photo by Addania\"></p>\n<p>Afterwards go to the <code>Config</code> tab and select <code>Keyboard/Mouse</code> setting.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FvQdpkx.jpg\" title=\"Photo by Addania\"></p>\n<p>Enable the <code>Fn and Ctrl Key swap</code></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/avrwWxq.jpg\" title=\"Photo by Addania\"></p>\n<p>Then you can click <code>ESC</code> to exit this tab and navigate to <code>Restart</code> tab &#x26; select <code>Exit saving changes</code>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/o6u7l7v.jpg\" title=\"Photo by Addania\"></p>\n<p>You will obviously need to confirm that you want to save the configuration changes.\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uIt2Pmu.jpg%22Photo%20by%20Addania%22\"></p>\n<p>Result? Totally professionally hacked computer :))</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/38E4Bra.jpg\" title=\"Photo by Addania\"></p>\n<p>I am a Monster, I know ;)</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ecoffoD.png\" alt=\"drawing\" width=\"150\"/>","frontmatter":{"title":"ThinkPad Switch CTRL and FN key"},"excerpt":"The long-expected day has finally arrived when I got my completely brand new baby computer for my new role as Front-End Developer.
