If there are only couple of function files, their tests can reside next to them. This is to remind the future you or other developers not to forget to update tests when functions change. If there are many function files and main folder would be clattred, create a dedicated subfolder for tests.</p>\n<p>Reference:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation/\">https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation/</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/VwFJtH1.jpg\" title=\"Photo by Anastasiya Lobanovskaya from Pexels\"></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Colocation"},"excerpt":"\"Place code as close to where it's relevant as possible.\" Kent C.
