Which was already +3 to his company best from yesterday. Challenge accepted Daniel!</p>\n<p>Thinking it through I decided to go for regular push-ups in order to be\nable to compete with the others (the narrow ones are too tiresome). So in order to beat Daniel I needed 34 of em. Hmm, fine, FINE! Let's see what I have got!</p>\n<p>Ok, was not as difficult as I thought! Now, bring it on guys!! 40 push-ups here! ðŸ˜Ž +21 from yesterday which means 61 points altogether... :) Who is winning now?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I mean provided my friend and occassional trainer does not join the competition, haha. Then we are all screwed!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Back to coding - the very last step to finish my PR were final checks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So I prayed for the successful and merciful PR checks.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They failed again... and again.. and couple of times more. Dammit! Those storyshots.. Why do we even have storyshots? Why not to delete them completely? I mean, it makes complete sense. No storyshots, no failed PR checks. It's a win-win situation :)</p>\n<p>Phew, finally I somehow patched it together and got rid of this PR... I\nmean... said a loving farewell to this <s>cursed</s> lovely PR..</p>\n<p>Time for the new issue! Yay! And this time on a different product.\nPerfect! So let's make it start. I made sure and double-checked 2 weeks\nago, that everything is set and done on my computer for this product, I\ntamed the Docker, I resolved all its issues, and now it shall bow to me\nand obey my orders unless...</p>\n<p>Unless you try to start the Docker again.. Or even better, it DID start.. but then I could not login to the platform! I mean really? I set my credentials myself, they were in the .env file. Just how difficult is it to copy paste creds from one file to the app? Incredible, it did NOT work. How can it not work? Seriously Docker? Time to screw me up again?</p>\n<p>So happy times.. spent 3/4 of the day solving Docker issues again.. This Docker - such a drama queen. I start to really think it is a female :)</p>\n<p>Just look at the evidence:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>has its moods</li>\n<li>is unpredictable</li>\n<li>never does what you want it to do</li>\n<li>and I secretly even think it is vengeful (I mistyped it with \"i\" couple of times)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So what I needed to do is to stop all the Docker, remove all containers, wipe all the volumes, boot it clean all up again.. and of course pray to the Almight Docker God.. Now I see that being a programmer will apparently convert me to a believer! I already prayed more today than in my entire life :)</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xtsndFy.jpg?1\" alt=\"Photo by Sam Kolder from Pexels\" />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 19"},"excerpt":"27.03.2020 - Friday The day started with a colleague posting his 29 push-ups today.
