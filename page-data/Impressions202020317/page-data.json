Since unforgiving alarm clock woke me up at 5:50 and I actually maybe had fallen asleep after 1 am, the rest of the day and the world around me felt like in a haze.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason for the early-(dammit)-bird was to go to shop when they open to be able to buy groceries and make some small personal storage.. just in case.. Just thinking about it was freaking me out and actually doing it was really strange.. Especially, it was my first time when I decided that I should actually use at least a scarf around my face (because obviously I did not have any face mask, because where would I even get one??) and that turned out to be actually a good decision... Everyone in the streets were using them (am I still living in Slovakia?).. and there were even warnings on the shop doors and windows that it is prohibited to enter the store without a face mask. Wow, world <code>is</code> going crazy. This stuff is real! I guess I am not misplaced doing huge shopping for \"bad\" times. And I guess I should really start to look around to get myself a normal mask.. But how when even on the pharmacy door they had thousand posters: \"We do NOT have masks\"... But I went there nevertheless... at least to ask when they might have some for ordinary mortals... And when the woman saw me in that huge scarf clumsily wrapped around my mouth and nose.. she actually said nothing, just went to the backroom and brought one mask for me. She said there was one last mask left, so that I don't suffocate behind that scarf... Wow, I was so stunned that I actually got the mask when all my hopes were gone... Certainly treasure loot of the day <code>is</code> the mask. Funny how our rank of precious items changes under different circumstances. A luxury good - a rare epic turns out nowadays to be a simple small piece of white cloth and 2 strings...</p>\n<p>Later on I could not really identify my emotional state.</p>\n<p><code>Nervous</code> from the emergency shopping.</p>\n<p><code>In awe</code> from the luck I had with the mask.</p>\n<p><code>Rage</code> that the pharmacy shop actually <code>lied</code> about\nnot having masks, even though apparently that <code>did</code> have some!\nAnd also the way they are now in the position to decide who gets one and who doesn't. Maybe I should not analyze, becasue I got one.. but still.. if the pharmacist did not feel generous, I could have gone home with empty hands. And that bothers me...</p>\n<p>The rest of the day was very busy with working on my issue. The\nnervousness and haziness did not leave me though. Highlight certainly was a virtual lunch with my colleague. It was nice to see a familiar face from a fairy tale long time ago...</p>\n<p>Around afternoon I started to be very <code>very</code> tired. As my\nmentor pointed out.. I should not have been coding till midnight and I\nshould have rather rested in the evenings. That was actually true because I was starting to feel a headache somewhere at the back of my\nconsciousness, which did not prophet anything good. If this turns into\nmigrene, life will be very painful...</p>\n<p>In the evening I tried to distract myself with a nice conversation with a\nfriend. We agreed on a tea-and-cake hangout on Whatsapp. It was actually\nvery nice (even without actual tea or cake), but unfortunatelly my\nheadache was intensifying and soon I found myself struggling. So I had to\nstop the ever-interesting call and head to bed... I am screwed...</p>\n<p>Moral of the story [for my future self]: Adda, gotdammit, seriously, do\nnot be so over-ambitious and do <code>not</code> work till 1 am unless you\nreally have to. It is not worth a migrene..</p>\n<p><img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NLIHuc0.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo from telegraph.co.uk\"\n      /></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 11"},"excerpt":"17.03.2020 - Tuesday This was a weird day.
