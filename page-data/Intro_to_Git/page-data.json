Your REMOTE service will be accessible online at any time from any location by anyone who has access to it, meaning you or your colleague who is working on your project together with you.</p>\n<p>General Git workflow:\nFirst we need to link our LOCAL and REMOTE repositories using SSH Key.\nFirst we need to generate our LOCAL SSH key which we then paste to REMORE GitHub.</p>\n<p>Imagine I work on my project addania.com which is my personal website. I created my project locally on my PC. In order to connect it to Git I first need to create a sub-folder called git with includes initial git setup.\nSome softwares like Gatsby create this folder automatically. I can add this folder manually using Ubuntu terminal and providing git init command which will create a subfolder git in my current project folder.\nThen I work on my project files and make changes to my website. Firstly I need to add those files manually to the git folder LOCALLY on my PC. Git is not tracking live all the changes done in project. I need to tell to\nGit that now is the time when I want to log the changes I made so far. Therefore all my LOCAL files need to be added to LOCAL git repository ( we are not talking about Github yet). In order to to this LOCAL workflow:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message goes here\"</p>\n<p>When our LOCAL Git has logged our LOCAL changes we are ready to update our REMOTE repository, such as Github or Gitlab.</p>\n<p>Then we need to add our LOCAL git to REMOTE Github. Go to yout Github Repository and at the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.\nAfterwards we go to Ubuntu command and use following command, where remote repository URL is the URL we copied from Github and origin is the name of our remote repository (origin is just a convention):\ngit remote add origin remote repository URL\nfor example:\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:addania/addania.com.git </p>\n<p>To verify if our new remote was added we can check the git remote -v command.\nThen we are ready to puch our LOCAL git repository to the REMOTE Github repository:\ngit push origin master</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order to install git we need to have apt-get updated.
