Why to want to switch? Because some capabilities are not supported in certain versions of Node. For example, you have a project which has some dependencies on different packages. If you want to <code>npm install</code> them, then you get errors. One of the reasons can be that you are using latest (not yet stable) version of node.</p>\n<p>Node in general is installed globally for all projects. To be able to change versions we need to de-install it and only use NVM from now on to switch between versions. Each project can have different node version then. It is used a lot in professional dev life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Paste this to command line (it will be installed globally, no matter in which folder I currently am):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.1/install.sh | bash \n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Restart the terminal</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Write this so that NVM uses previous (already installed) SYSTEM version of NODE:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>nvm use system\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I want to see all shortcuts for nvm</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>nvm\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If I want to see current version</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>nvm current\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To install a specific version of the node <strong>GLOBALLY</strong> to be able to use it later on in the project:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<pre><code>nvm install 10.0.0\n</code></pre>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then we will need to add the different version of node to a specific project. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Go to project directory</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the root location of the project (where package.json is) create a new file with touch command.
