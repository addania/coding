At the end we see score-board of who is winning.</p>\n<p>Nice, challenge accepted! And of course as everyone was doing either\nnormal push-ups or ladies push-ups, I decided to be a black sheep and I\ndid narrow ones :) I did 21, just to beat the guy who announced the\ncompetition ðŸ˜ˆ Was fun!</p>\n<p>Apart from that, today evening was supposed to be an official deployment of the new UI and my PR was still not ready! I mean it would have been finished from my side, only if it wasn't for my lovely colleageus, who requested 1 billion of changes.. even at 9 pm at night.. Well, as I was so dedicated to really make it on time today, I worked till 11 or 12 pm to make it happen..</p>\n<p>It did not happen.. as I still needed some feedback from colleagues, final approval and QA testing. There goes my beautiful PR being part of the first major deployment.. at least since I'm in dev team - which means since 2,5 weeks :)</p>\n<p>Ok, so I decided that the <code>next</code> deployment will be the\n<code>major</code> and the <code>most important</code> deployment. And I\nwill make it to <code>that</code> one :)</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aNIKTsL.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Karl Solano from Pexels\" />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 18"},"excerpt":"26.03.2020 - Thursday Now we are talking!
