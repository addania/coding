Colleague and I finally re-partitioned the disc\nto have enough space for all upcoming devilish projects and for.. Docker\n(gosh why I keep mistyping the Docker with <code>i</code>). Docker beware!\nHere I come again! Full firepower this time! And this time I defeat you!\nAnd so did I... almost...technically... or at least in theory. Cause...\n<code>ANOTHER</code> error! So I summoned the Docker Wizard Jan :) and we\nspent entire afternoon figuring it out. Only it turned out it was not the\nDocker issue.</p>\n<p>It turned out the <code>npm start</code> was completely broken for entire\nfrontend team. Then I am thinking ... why NOBODY screamed before? I guess\nthe dev world was waiting for a <code>hero</code> to save them.. :) cough*\ncough* (oh no... hero with Corona?)!</p>\n<p>And yes, today was a big day when I finalized my pro master hipster setup:</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZHI8A86.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n<p>Finally 2 huge screens plus the one from laptop. No more compromises with\n1 tiny little screen where I try to cramp 6 small windows next to each\nother. It is time to live in the lap of luxury, where each window has its\ndedicated section! No more <code>alt-tabing</code> endlessly in the\n<code>inception</code> of windows.

The rest two are decorations\" :)* </p>\n<p>Worth mentioning is also my pro master hipster\n<code>water --> tea --> coffee</code> setup (from left to right). Just in case\nyou haven't noticed :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 7"},"excerpt":"11.03.2020 - Wednesday Great stuff is happening today! I got assigned to my very first pod, yay!
