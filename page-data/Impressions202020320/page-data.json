Which started great, because it seemed as a very\nsimilar task to the previous one and I was already starting to feel a bit more comfy and tiny fraction more confident, that I actually start to understand at least a bit of it.</p>\n<p>And then I realized what the issue actually <code>is</code> about and how\nextensive my code re-design is supposed to be. I took a break to cry, eat (whatever) (...ok all of the) sweets I had at home (which by the way was an entire stock of rations for a month time of apocalypse...), then I cried a bit again and afterwards on the recommendation of my mentor I took the second look at it... and even a <code>bonus</code> third one... It still looked the same... so I wrapped the working day up and hoped that something magical will happen over the weekend, that on Monday I will wake up and everything will be crystal clear and I simply do it... Let's see...</p>\n<p>As a rebellion to that I decided to make progress on meaningful stuff in my life... and played Heroes of Might and Magic 5 until 2 am :) And then I remembered that some time ago someone mentioned to me that humans should actually engage themselves in something called sleep. Fair enough, I should give it a try (from time to time).
