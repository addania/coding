You have\n<code>30 seconds</code> to engage your fellow travellers (who happen to be\nyour colleagues) in a very serious conversation about very serious topics\nlike weather and stuff :) As I find weather topic boring, I usually ask\n<code>\"how are you?\"</code> But not out of politeness as most people do\nwho never expect or interest themselves in the actual answer. I usually am\ngenuinely interested in what they say :) Especially after the weekend, I\nam eager to hear those weekend stories, how people spend their life\noutside of work. But as it happens to be a Monday, the answer to\n<code>\"how are you?\"</code> is however typically:\n<code>\"Yeah, you know.. Monday\"</code>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For most work-bound souls, Monday has become an <code>adjective.</code> Monday has become the the <code>state</code> of spirit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But when I ask people how they are, it is also for me a small\nretrospective moment to actually give a brief check on my own emotional\nstate. And what I surprisingly found this particular Monday was that I was\nactually <code>looking forward</code> to go to job! Just like entire last\nweek. And so unlike so many weeks before. Tracing back to... years even.\nWow, what a delightful plot twist. What a peaceful feeling that it{\" \"}\n<code>is</code> actually possible to like the job and to be (at least for\na brief moment in life)... simply <code>content</code>.</p>\n<p>The peaceful moment lasted.. for about that lift ride :) As afterwards I\ntried to make another repo work on my local, following very short guide (5\ninstructions) and failed on the very last one - installing Docker.. I am\ncursed with this Docker, it keeps resisting my attempts to tame it. Error\nmessage was quite clear: <code>Low on disc space</code>.. What was not\nclear though was... how on EARTH I can run out of disc space after [\"one\",\n\"ein\", \"um\", \"jeden\"] week of having brand new pc? Aaaanyhow, seems like\nissue with initial system installation. And... Dom is on holiday. Issue\nwill have to wait till Wednesday. Time for progress on studying\nTypescript.</p>\n<p>Oh and evening was quite interesting. Signed up for a 1 hour meditation\nworkshop on Mindvalley. Was really pleasant to silence the thoughts and\nenjoy some peace in my own head :)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 5"},"excerpt":"09.03.2020 - Monday You know how those lift conversations go..
