No joking this time. It was a day when I said farewell to many of my clients oficially. And many of them told me some heart-catching words of which I am extremely proud of but at the same time, it made me feel sentimental. At such moments I really understand what I have been building during those more than 4 years - bonds. Which can be tough sometimes but strong and beautfiul at the same time! Here are some of the words my clients told me. And I will miss all of them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Addania, thanks a lot for the call today, it was really useful because I think it will still take some time to find everything you need. Congratulations for your new career opportunities, that sounds great. It was also real pleasure working with you, thank you for everything, the collaboration with you was really great and we will miss you as our account manager. Wish you all the best and good luck for your new position. Best, Mona</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Addania, Thanks for your contribution and helping us. XXX is not a perfect tool (and I think perfect tool doesnâ€™t exist), however you did a brilliant job during your time of engagement. You was able to provide guidance to resolve the issues, escalate when we had needed urgent help, to provide the right direction to help us to update our process, schedule some calls to ensure to all going good from our side, and get the best of Adverity. You told me during the call to send you any feedback or suggestion that I can give you about Adverity. I saw that there is a Ticket system when customer have a problem, but I cannot see  any section related to recommendation/satisfaction expected after Tickets. I think it will be good to have it. Like this I will be able to put all of above on it ðŸ˜Š. I wish you the best for you on your new challenge. The world is small, maybe we will have the opportunity to rework together. If it happens, it will be a pleasure. Take care and have a nice day ! Thanks again !!! Amine</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hi Addania, Thank you for presentation today. It was really useful. It has been great working with you and best of luck with your job in the company! Tanja</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the first time I see on the video and now you are saying goodbye to me? Amine</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hallo Addania, bin jetzt mal so frei und antworte auf Deutsch. Das sind aber schlechte Nachrichten fÃ¼r uns, auch wenn es tolle Nachrichten fÃ¼r dich sind. GlÃ¼ckwunsch zu einem weiteren Schritt auf deinem Weg. Danke, Andreas</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Addnia.Many thanks for your always friendly and competent support and your patience with us. Wish you all the best in your new role! Best Antonius</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So is this the last time we hear each other? Marti</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes Marti, it is the last time :(</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/6COEA4h.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Helena Lopes from Pexels\" />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 30"},"excerpt":"14.04.2020 - Tuesday Today I cried.
