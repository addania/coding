My very very <code>1st </code>\n        day as a Front-End Developer... The day <code>0</code>, since obviously\n        all acceptably decent indices shall start with zero.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />A day a bit chaotic as I was settling in my new corner of the\n      office.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      But a day with a <code>MohnKuchen</code> which propheted an excellent day.\n      After all, what can go wrong when you have a prospect of a delicious cake\n      and warm cup of tea from our CTO (Chief Tea Officer) to combat literally\n      ANY challenge in life? They say <code>piece of cake</code> for a reason,\n      don't they? :)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day when I <i>actually</i> talked to <i>actual</i> developers. And\n      they\n      <i> actually</i> talked BACK :) Thank you <code>MohnKuchen</code> ;)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with <code>muscle tomcat</code>. Yes, yes, dear Austrians: ein\n      Tag mit Muskelkater :) from previous day(s) of intense training and ...\n      let's admit it... carrying that <code>MohnKuchen</code> all the way to the\n      office.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day deeply satisfying as I finally achieved my long desired goal.\n      The hard work for past months has finally paid off. Dream turning\n      inevitably into reality right in front of my eyes. It seems a bit surreal,\n      it seems a bit... well plain even, earthy maybe. But <code>MINE</code>.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with a small <code>victory</code> to setup my first\n      professional dev environment.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day which ended up with an intriguing <code>puzzle</code> to look\n      forward to solving the next day :)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with an after-work <code>hangout</code> which turned out to be\n      more pleasant than expected.\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>Total score: The day freaking ROCKED :)</blockquote>\n      <br />\n      And yes, the <code>cake</code> was the most important part of it :)\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aRwy8mP.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Antonio Quagliata from Pexels\"\n      />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 0"},"excerpt":""}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/imp/"}}}
