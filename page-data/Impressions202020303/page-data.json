My wildly lucky guess\n<code>admin admin</code> did not work. But I got an insider tip that the\nsecond half of the riddle I have solved already, muhahahaha. So now only\nto get the first one right.</p>\n<p>Tadaaa! Mission accomplished! Addania +1 Hacker Skills. It is only my\nsecond day and I am totally pro already :)) ...<em>cough cough</em></p>\n<p>Another achievement of the day: I made my very first\n<code>code review</code> today ðŸ˜Ž It was extremely serious change request:\ncorrect a typo, haha. One must always start somewhere :) Tough life of\nbeginners.</p>\n<p>And I finally finished setup for the main app thanks to couple of (4)\npeople who helped me make it work after we realized that our internal wiki\nis outdated and there are some backend issues.</p>\n<p>And the highlight of the day was\n<code>New Starters After-Work Pizza</code>. Technically I am not a new\nstarter in the company, however I am new starter in the dev team, so I\njoined the event and it was hilarious to talk to my new team. They are\nsimply amazing and super funny. I love those dev jokes. I didn't want to\nleave as I was having lots of fun, but the time was running short for my\nTuesday's Sports Group. It would suck if the teacher didn't arrive :)) So\nI had to. And the yoga class was actually nice, relaxing, yet challenging.\nCause without a challenge it would be boring ;)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 1"},"excerpt":"03.03.2020 - Tuesday First things first... yes, leftovers from the cake are still in the fridge.. will be another great day :) And now backâ€¦"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Impressions202020303/"}}}
