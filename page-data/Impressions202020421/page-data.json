I proudly can say that my body is already in a perfect regime, works like a Swiss watch. Hundred and ten percent of reliability. Such a good feeling that I have a comfy schedule and my body plays along.</p>\n<p>So as usually I woke up, made a hot and beautifully scented tea, prepared my breakfast and ate them while my computer was starting up. There was a small problem which I was testing and wanted to write to my boss that something is not possible. He was still offline, weird... he is always online before me. But it gave me time to think before I hit the send button to unleash the message. So I tried it once again and I SOLVED it! I made it work! Omg, I totally rock today, only 15 minutes into work and I am already solving the impossible :) </p>\n<p>As proud as I was, I had another sip of my tea and looked at my phone which announced 7:00 am... Wait a minute... What the...???</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>And because I was on a great track of solving issue which I could not solve yesterday, I decided to simply continue working :) Early bird, me :) And it was successful. So much that I actually completely forgot the reality around me. </p>\n<p>I start to think that coding has some weird impact on perception of reality for people who program. It really seems sometimes difficult to embrace things happening around me while I am so much consumed in code. </p>\n<p>To ground myself I decided to take a nice long lunch break. By long I mean, more than my usual 5 minutes :) Today, I will have a great lunch in the company of my mum. She baked a delicious salmon! I love salmon and this delicacy deserves me to prepare some yummy salad to it. Salad with my favourite sun dried, oil pickled tomatoes, with a sprinkle of grazed parmesan on top of it. Nom Nom Nom. I took the plate full of my delicious salad, sat at the table and started to eat with a smile on my face. My mum was looking at me weirdly when she finally asked: \"And the salmon?\"</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>What is happening to me today??</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 35"},"excerpt":"21.04.2020 - Tuesday Today I woke up perfectly 10 minutes before my alarm clock: 8:35 am, as usual nowadays.
