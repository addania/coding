And not only me, because obviously I asked everyone who I dared to bother :) And it was not really an easy one. And the answer was, <code>of course</code> it was hiding where I was <code>already</code> looking couple of times, but because of my eyes I did not see it. And because of course, why would we call things with their proper names? That would be too easy.. It is way more adventurous to call stuff in puzzles, riddles, foreign languages and poems so that nobody understands..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>O <code>Stack</code>, <code>Stack</code> wherefore art thou <code>Stack</code>?</br>\nDeny thy father and refuse thy <code>name</code>.</br>\nOr if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love</br>\nAnd I’ll no longer be a <code>Workspace</code>.</br>\n‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy:</br>\nThou art thyself, though not an <code>Organization</code>.</br>\nWhat’s <code>Organization</code>? It is nor hand nor foot</br>\nNor arm nor face nor any other part </br>\nBelonging to a man. O be some other <code>name</code>!!!</br></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the rest of the day I spent testing. Most importantly I tested an\nissue of my friend, which made it special and fun. And then we spent\nentire evening talking about it :) Was very nice. And right before going\nto bed I did some midnight push-ups, just to keep my score ;)</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jCYh6AG.jpg\" alt=\"Photo from dong.world\" />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 23"},"excerpt":"02.04.2020 - Thursday To be, or not to be (a url), that is the question: or maybe the question:\n\"Where the hell can I get that url from…"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/Impressions202020402/"}}}
