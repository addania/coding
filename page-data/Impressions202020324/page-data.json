Under new circumstanes of course, with new routine, with some adjustments and workarounds. But it soon becomes the new usual. Which is good. Which means you stopped panicking and started adapting. Because all emotions even panic has an expiry date when your body runs into emotional exhaustion and that is the breakpoint when you embrace your new situation and start acting to the best of your given circumstances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So yes, days start to pass in a very similar rythm. I certainly do not\nmiss travelling 3 hours a day for job. I can sleep longer and still start my working day earlier than before. Which feels much more productive. Which is certainly great. Also the isolation does not YET feel that horrible. Because with modern technology I do feel connected to people whom I want to be in contact with. This will probably change very soon, because 1,5 week alone is still nothing compared to maybe months... or who knows how long this situation is going to take. Prognosis do not look good at all.</p>\n<p>Back to coding. Speaking of general productivity, yes, I certainly work\nmore and more efficient. Today my boss re-prioritized my tasks and I had to start a new issue, which I was able to also finish today. But the rest of the day was very scattered as I still needed to finish some manual work for my ex department and some clients decided that TODAY is the perfect day to snow me under with emails. So deving was not as good as I wanted it to be. But as I am still in dual position, torn apart between two departnemnts, I need to grinch my teeth and simply do it. Soon, very soon, I can hand over all my clients and focus 101% on programming, yay!!</p>\n<p>And today I also started to learn about redux, so that I can make progress on my issue. Wow, found a great tutorial from the author of redux, great stuff... not that great English accent :) I really cannot make myself not mentioning it, hahahaha, as I found it so difficult to understand him from time to time, but overall the tutorial is absolutely awesome, very educative, very insightful! :) So google it, go for it! In case you are interested.</p>\n<p>And evening was really great! Had an upper body training with my friend. My legs are still crying from the leg training with him on Sunday. Was time to destroy my arms as well. So that the Addania is finished off completely :) Now that I am thinking about it, I wonder what his intentions are.. and I even allow him to destroy me.. dammit :)</p>\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eLZBYsE.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Polina Tankilevitch from Pexels\" />","frontmatter":{"title":"Dev day 16"},"excerpt":"24.03.2020 - Tuesday When initial shock from pandemics subsides, you begin to live your ordinary life.
