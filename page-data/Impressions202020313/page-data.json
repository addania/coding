I was considering to travel to my\nfamily in the evening or not. As tempting as it was (even having a\ncolleague who would give me a ride), I decided against it. After all I\nhave been in Vienna for past weeks where situation is much more severe\nthan in Slovakia and where I have been exposed to lots and lots of people\nin trains, U-bahn, job, outside of job.. Which increases probability of\npotential danger even if I do not have any symptoms. So it would not be\nwise and responsible now to pose the same risk to my family. As much as I\nmiss them, they and their health are much more important to me than my\nloneliness.</p>\n<p>Anyway, today I did some QA testing for the issue implemented by my\ncolleague and then I literally spent entire day (until midnight) browsing\nthe code, playing around, testing some of my hypothesis and trying to\nfigure things out. You can tell that it was very interesting that it kept\nme awake for so long. And I think to invest some of my private time now\ninto discovering things on my own could make a difference in long run.
