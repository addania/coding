Installation will result in having a completely new operational (sub)system (along side with Windows). When using this Windows Subsystem for Ubuntu, it only allows for command line, it doesnt have any user interface. Only interaction with the operational system is via command line (terminal). This system will be then used with Gatsby to create webpages and push my code to Github. Please note, upon first installation of Ubuntu subsystem, it is a completely blank software. It wont have access to my previously installed programms on Windows (like node.js, etc). Therefore we will need to install everything again.</p>\n<p>Ubuntu directory on PC:</p>\n<p>\\wsl$\\Ubuntu-18.04\\home\\addania</p>\n<p>Controls:</p>\n<p>Copy/Paste works differently in Ubuntu: ctrl+shift+c for copy, crtl+shift+v for paste\nSome commands will start with sudo which means to run as administrator\nj and k keys allows navigate up and down\nh and l allow to navigate left and right</p>\n<p>Commands:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to show which directory I am currently in we use command pwd (print working directory)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>pwd</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to display list of all files in a current directory</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ls</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to display list of all files in a current directory including hidden files (those with ., ex: .git)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>ls -a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>change directory cd + name of the directory (ex: cd src will go to folder called src in your currnet folder), this is to go one directory down the tree</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>cd src</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to go one directory up the tree</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>cd ..</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to create a folder</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>mkdir</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to create a new file called global.css</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>touch global.css</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Homebrew:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>see current version of homebrew</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>brew -v</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>update brew</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>brew update</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>installing software hello</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>brew install hello</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>install node</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>brew install node</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>checking version of node</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>node --version</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Git:</strong></p>\n<p>Git is a file versioning system. </p>\n<p>Some Git definitions first:</p>\n<p>LOCAL\nWhen we talk about LOCAL we mean anything that is stored locally on your computer harddrive</p>\n<p>REMOTE\nWhen we talk about REMOTE we mean anything that is stored and backed-up centrally on some 3rd party service, such as GitHub. Your REMOTE service will be accessible online at any time from any location by anyone who has access to it, meaning you or your colleague who is working on your project together with you.</p>\n<p>General Git workflow:\nFirst we need to link our LOCAL and REMOTE repositories using SSH Key.\nFirst we need to generate our LOCAL SSH key which we then paste to REMORE GitHub.</p>\n<p>Imagine I work on my project addania.com which is my personal website. I created my project locally on my PC. In order to connect it to Git I first need to create a sub-folder called git with includes initial git setup.\nSome softwares like Gatsby create this folder automatically. I can add this folder manually using Ubuntu terminal and providing git init command which will create a subfolder git in my current project folder.\nThen I work on my project files and make changes to my website. Firstly I need to add those files manually to the git folder LOCALLY on my PC. Git is not tracking live all the changes done in project. I need to tell to\nGit that now is the time when I want to log the changes I made so far. Therefore all my LOCAL files need to be added to LOCAL git repository ( we are not talking about Github yet). In order to to this LOCAL workflow:\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"message goes here\"</p>\n<p>When our LOCAL Git has logged our LOCAL changes we are ready to update our REMOTE repository, such as Github or Gitlab.</p>\n<p>Then we need to add our LOCAL git to REMOTE Github. Go to yout Github Repository and at the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.\nAfterwards we go to Ubuntu command and use following command, where remote repository URL is the URL we copied from Github and origin is the name of our remote repository (origin is just a convention):\ngit remote add origin remote repository URL\nfor example:\ngit remote add origin git@github.com:addania/addania.com.git </p>\n<p>To verify if our new remote was added we can check the git remote -v command.\nThen we are ready to puch our LOCAL git repository to the REMOTE Github repository:\ngit push origin master</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order to install git we need to have apt-get updated.

Reach allows to build interactive websites using components and allowing having html css and Javascript in one file.\nReact is a closed environmnet and can be run in browser, on your local machine (my pc) or on phones (such as Android, etc).</p>\n<p>When I am developing a website in React I need to be able to see what I am building. I can do these:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A: doubleclick on my html file (index.html) and open it in browser. However, it wont really work. Other pages will not load, because I am only openineg filepath in browser.</li>\n<li>B: run a web server locally on my machine (pc)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In order to run a web server on my machine, I need to install node.js</p>\n<p>In order to be able to use React in a BROWSER I need package called reactDOM package if I want to display it in browser. If I dont want to install reactDOM package, I can still use script tags in my html file, like so:</p>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js\" crossorigin></script>\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js\" crossorigin></script>\n<p>More on this in official documentation here:<a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html\">https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html</a></p>\n<p>These script tags in html are equivalent to a file in my project called package.json which is automatically provided by Gatsby:</p>\n<p>\"dependencies\": {\n\"gatsby\": \"^2.15.28\",\n\"react\": \"^16.10.0\",\n\"react-dom\": \"^16.10.0\"\n},</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Node.js</strong></p>\n<p>Advantages of Node.js</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Creates Runtime Environments (local webserver)\nNode.js is a JavaScript runtime environment. It allows JavaScript to run outside of a BROWSER, for example I could run it on my local machine as a standalone application (localhost:8000) and play around with my page. Gatsby uses node.js to create the local host. Also create-react-app uses node.js to create the runtime environment.</li>\n<li>Enables to install cool packages(=libraries=modules)\nNode.js comes automatically with npm (node package manager), no need to install it extra! Package manager is included in every programming language. Package manager is a collection of software tools that automates the process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and removing computer programs. In NPM the package manager manages all the cool packages I might actually need. npm I can only install packages which run in browser. Example of packages: </li>\n</ol>\n<p>react - allows access to all react modules/features like React.Component</p>\n<p>reactDOM - allows to generate react in the browser (unless I want to use script tags in html), for example: ReactDOM.render()</p>\n<p>create-react-app - enables to setup initial react files and create a runtime environment on local machine as localhost:8000. It ALSO automatically includes react and reactDOM packages</p>\n<p>gatsby - allows to build websites with multiple pages easier. It ALSO automatically includes react and reactDOM packages</p>\n<p>Each package needs to be installed by npm individually.</p>\n<p>2 ways how to download a package/any other software:</p>\n<p>A) go to webside -> click download -> run installer and install the software</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>B) use package managers - package manager MUST be run in command line</p>\n<p>Commands:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>to install your favourite package</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>npm install react</p>\n<p>npm install reactDOM</p>\n<p>npm install create-react-app</p>\n<p>npm install gatsby</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order to see which packages=libraries=modules my project is using I search for file called package.json.
