I always find myself wondering should I use bracket or is brace also an actually word for a bracket? And how do parentheses mix in all of the chaos?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then I found a random <a href=\"https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~matuszek/General/JavaSyntax/parentheses.html\">article</a> and it turns out that each of above means something different. At least in American English. So there actually seems to be some level of ORDER in this mess (in scientific terms it is called <code>controlled chaos</code>, where you know exactly where your stuff is even if your mother tells you that \"this MESS is horrendeous\"). So let's debunk it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Parentheses</strong> are smooth: <code>()</code> and we love them!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Brackets</strong> are actually square brackets: <code>[]</code> and are a bit more difficult to type on the (German) keyboard, but at least they are still close enough to each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Braces</strong> are actually curly braces: <code>{}</code> and are more difficult to type and more distant from each other.
