You have{\" \"}\n      <code>30 seconds</code> to engage your fellow travellers (who happen to be\n      your colleagues) in a very serious conversation about very serious topics\n      like weather and stuff :) As I find weather topic boring, I usually ask{\" \"}\n      <code>\"how are you?\"</code> But not out of politeness as most people do\n      who never expect or interest themselves in the actual answer. I usually am\n      genuinely interested in what they say :) Especially after the weekend, I\n      am eager to hear those weekend stories, how people spend their life\n      outside of work. But as it happens to be a Monday, the answer to{\" \"}\n      <code>\"how are you?\"</code> is however typically:{\" \"}\n      <code>\"Yeah, you know.. Monday\"</code>.\n      <blockquote>\n        For most work-bound souls, Monday has become an <code>adjective.</code>{\" \"}\n        Monday has become the the <code>state</code> of spirit.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      But when I ask people how they are, it is also for me a small\n      retrospective moment to actually give a brief check on my own emotional\n      state. And what I surprisingly found this particular Monday was that I was\n      actually <code>looking forward</code> to go to job! Just like entire last\n      week. And so unlike so many weeks before. Tracing back to... years even.\n      Wow, what a delightful plot twist. What a peaceful feeling that it{\" \"}\n      <code>is</code> actually possible to like the job and to be (at least for\n      a brief moment in life)... simply <code>content</code>.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The peaceful moment lasted.. for about that lift ride :) As afterwards I\n      tried to make another repo work on my local, following very short guide (5\n      instructions) and failed on the very last one - installing Docker.. I am\n      cursed with this Docker, it keeps resisting my attempts to tame it. Error\n      message was quite clear: <code>Low on disc space</code>.. What was not\n      clear though was... how on EARTH I can run out of disc space after [\"one\",\n      \"ein\", \"um\", \"jeden\"] week of having brand new pc? Aaaanyhow, seems like\n      issue with initial system installation. And... Dom is on holiday. Issue\n      will have to wait till Wednesday. Time for progress on studying\n      Typescript.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Oh and evening was quite interesting. Signed up for a 1 hour meditation\n      workshop on Mindvalley.

And I was such a good apprentice, so bright\n      and fast-learner and uncomplicated, that my mentor totally did NOT HAVE TO\n      take his laptop and move to a table right next to me, so that he doesn't\n      need to walk all way to my place every few seconds when I had another\n      thousand of questions :) Hey, at least I had a neighbour!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And as all my new colleagues are so nice to me and help me out, I decided\n      to purchase a special treat for them.\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/al6QpWq.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />I\n      called it a <s>bribe</s>.. thank-you package :)\n      <br />\n      - the 1st one for the 1st colleagues\n      <br />- the 2nd one for <s>the 2nd coll</s>.. ok, for ME.\n      <br />\n      - the rest of them, yes, for ME as well :)\n      <br />\n      One of them was already missing in the picture (that was the first one..)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The afternoon was rather confusing. I really wanted to concentrate on\n      coding, but as my Slovak colleague was bombarding me with latest\n      announcements from Slovak government that they are closing borders with\n      Austria and everyone coming to the country from abroad will be kept in\n      quaranteen, I was slowly starting to be nervous about being even able to\n      come home today.\n      <br />\n      <br />I completely forgot about the German course and we also cancelled\n      the{\" \"}\n      <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8Tj5BBW9tM\">\n        Team Alpha-Super-Awesome-Cool-Dynamite-Wolf-Squadron\n      </a>{\" \"}\n      after-work hangout and soon I was rushing to the train station hoping that\n      the trains to Slovakia would not be cancelled yet (as some trains to Italy\n      and Switzerland had been already for couple of days). And as the company\n      announced yesterday that we all would be taking home office from next\n      Monday on and after agreement with my own boss to be able to already start\n      my home office tomorrow, I was packed with my laptop, with a huge bag with\n      all my stuff from the fridge. And seeing all other people also rushing to\n      the Bratislava train with also huge bags and some of them even with their{\" \"}\n      <code>monitors</code>... it totally felt like an...{\" \"}\n      <code>evacuation</code>. Which I guess it actually <strong>was</strong>.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Brrr... spooky train ride back home. There was such a heavy and somber\n      atmosphere hanging (even stuck) in the air. Or was it just me?\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      __________________________\n      <br />\n      <i>(on the bright) Side (Note):</i>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Today I finally got my bath robe back from ... someone. Yeah, because it\n      is perfectly fine to have people safe-keeping (and because you can never\n      be sure) and/or wearing your bath robes :) Anyhow, it was my favourite\n      bath robe (because it was the only one) and for almost a year it was...\n      away. So now I finally got it back and brought this treasure home. Only I\n      brought it with an uninvited guest. It turned out to be a host of a...{\" \"}\n      <code>Motte</code>!!

I try to focus on my job, but it just\n      feels strange. Kind of out of this space.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Ok, decision has been made, emergency shopping (just to be on the safe\n      side and prepared for any eventuality [of an apocalypse]):\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/F3JevVz.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      Now whatever happens, I will be fine (dose of chocolate solves every\n      problem in the world, does it not?).\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And I made a tough decision today. I was considering to travel to my\n      family in the evening or not. As tempting as it was (even having a\n      colleague who would give me a ride), I decided against it. After all I\n      have been in Vienna for past weeks where situation is much more severe\n      than in Slovakia and where I have been exposed to lots and lots of people\n      in trains, U-bahn, job, outside of job.. Which increases probability of\n      potential danger even if I do not have any symptoms. So it would not be\n      wise and responsible now to pose the same risk to my family. As much as I\n      miss them, they and their health are much more important to me than my\n      loneliness.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Anyway, today I did some QA testing for the issue implemented by my\n      colleague and then I literally spent entire day (until midnight) browsing\n      the code, playing around, testing some of my hypothesis and trying to\n      figure things out. You can tell that it was very interesting that it kept\n      me awake for so long. And I think to invest some of my private time now\n      into discovering things on my own could make a difference in long run. And\n      especially when it actually makes <code>fun</code> :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And here is my <code>home office</code> setup:\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LE1F5XE.jpg\" alt=\"Photo by Addania\" />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 10: 16.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      Feels weird when you know that entire crew is working from home office\n      today (and who knows how long) due to the emergency situation with the\n      Corona virus. Everyone is worried and starts to take the quarantine\n      seriously. You find it difficult to actually think about work as at the\n      back of your head the whole situation (which feel absurd) plays on repeat.\n      And you feel so remote, so alone, so detached from everything and\n      everyone. And then suddenly you receive a slack message from a colleague:\n      <blockquote>\n        \"Good morning! Just don't want to lose the habits of the normal life\"{\" \"}\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Yes, one must love their colleagues :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Apart from everything, today I was really motivated to make some{\" \"}\n      <code>serious</code> progress on my <code>very first </code>\n      issue. Especially because I had been planning to work on it during the\n      weekend, which... somehow... not sure how... actually did <code>\n        not\n      </code>{\" \"}\n      happen :) So I decided to make up for it today! And.. I failed..\n      miserably.\n      <br />\n      <br />I kinda knew there will be times which will be tough and when I will\n      feel stuck. But.. did they have to come, like.. <code>already</code>? Do\n      they need to come like.. <code>every 10 minutes</code>? :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Luckily my mentor is a very patient man. But even him after 50 minutes\n      call trying to actually explain to me what is expected from me in the\n      issue, even he pointed out that he hopes that now I understand since he\n      already spent 50 minutes on me :) Yes, well... hmm... felt humbling, but\n      come on, I need to understand what I should do before I can even start,\n      right? RIGHT?\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The evening was very pleasant! Spent it playing Age of Empires II online\n      with a friend! And of course we won! :) It could not have been any other\n      way, we are pros! And at least for a brief moment it did not feel so\n      lonely in this apartment. It alomst felt.... normal again.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Afterwards I decided to still browse some code, explore things on my own,\n      so that I do not feel so dumb all the time. And yes, there was a second\n      reason which I did not want to admit to myself that actually was any\n      reason... I was kind of nervous about the whole situation and that I was\n      adviced by a friend to think about making some small stock of food for\n      myself...you know.. just in case. I <code>DO NOT</code> want to admit that\n      I might need stuff for <code>just in case</code>. Because then it really\n      starts to be scary... But at the same time it is rational! But I better do\n      it tomorrow morning right when they open up (which is 6am...gosh). And\n      yes, being nervous is a <code>no-go</code> to sleep for me. So I was awake\n      till 1 am pretending to be working, while just in reality trying to make\n      myself exhausted so that I would fall asleep.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Which I did!\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/FgPQNGV.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Marina Shatskih from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 11: 17.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        This was a weird day. Since unforgiving alarm clock woke me up at 5:50\n        and I actually maybe had fallen asleep after 1 am, the rest of the day\n        and the world around me felt like in a haze.{\" \"}\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The reason for the early-(dammit)-bird was to go to shop when they open to\n      be able to buy groceries and make some small personal storage.. just in\n      case.. Just thinking about it was freaking me out and actually doing it\n      was really strange.. Especially, it was my first time when I decided that\n      I should actually use at least a scarf around my face (because obviously I\n      did not have any face mask, because where would I even get one??) and that\n      turned out to be actually a good decision... Everyone in the streets were\n      using them (am I still living in Slovakia?).. and there were even warnings\n      on the shop doors and windows that it is prohibited to enter the store\n      without a face mask. Wow, world <code>is</code> going crazy. This stuff is\n      real! I guess I am not misplaced doing huge shopping for \"bad\" times. And\n      I guess I should really start to look around to get myself a normal mask..\n      But how when even on the pharmacy door they had thousand posters: \"We do\n      NOT have masks\"... But I went there nevertheless... at least to ask when\n      they might have some for ordinary mortals... And when the woman saw me in\n      that huge scarf clumsily wrapped around my mouth and nose.. she actually\n      said nothing, just went to the backroom and brought one mask for me. She\n      said there was one last mask left, so that I don't suffocate behind that\n      scarf... Wow, I was so stunned that I actually got the mask when all my\n      hopes were gone... Certainly treasure loot of the day <code>is</code> the\n      mask. Funny how our rank of precious items changes under different\n      circumstances. A luxury good - a rare epic turns out nowadays to be a\n      simple small piece of white cloth and 2 strings...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Later on I could not really identify my emotional state. <br />\n      <br />\n      <code>Nervous </code>\n      from the emergency shopping.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <code>In awe</code> from the luck I had with the mask.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <code>Rage</code> that the pharmacy shop actually <code>lied</code> about\n      not having masks, even though apparently that <code>did</code> have some!\n      And also the way they are now in the position to decide who gets one and\n      who doesn't. Maybe I should not analyze, becasue I got one.. but still..\n      if the pharmacist did not feel generous, I could have gone home with empty\n      hands. And that bothers me...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The rest of the day was very busy with working on my issue. The\n      nervousness and haziness did not leave me though. Highlight certainly was\n      a virtual lunch with my colleague. It was nice to see a familiar face from\n      a fairy tale long time ago...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Around afternoon I started to be very <code>very</code> tired. As my\n      mentor pointed out.. I should not have been coding till midnight and I\n      should have rather rested in the evenings. That was actually true because\n      I was starting to feel a headache somewhere at the back of my\n      consciousness, which did not prophet anything good. If this turns into\n      migrene, life will be very painful...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      In the evening I tried to distract myself with a nice conversation with a\n      friend. We agreed on a tea-and-cake hangout on Whatsapp. It was actually\n      very nice (even without actual tea or cake), but unfortunatelly my\n      headache was intensifying and soon I found myself struggling. So I had to\n      stop the ever-interesting call and head to bed... I am screwed...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Moral of the story [for my future self]: Adda, gotdammit, seriously, do\n      not be so over-ambitious and do <code>not</code> work till 1 am unless you\n      really have to. It is not worth a migrene..\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NLIHuc0.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo from telegraph.co.uk\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 12: 18.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        When you wake up and the first thing your consciousness reckognizes is\n        that your head is exploding like fireworks, even after a full night\n        sleep, you know that this is going to be one very very VERY\n        looooooooooong and an utterly miserable day for you...\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      And the only thing you actually wish for right away is the day to be over.\n      But guess what... you <code>need</code> to work and you have wonderful 8\n      hours ahead of you where you are expected to deliver and perform! Yay! :)\n      What is more, being a developer means that those 8 hours will be well\n      spent staring at the computer screen (which for a migrene is the worst\n      thing imaginable) and trying to make your <code>brain</code> work. Which\n      already refuses even to think about having the eyes opened. Will be fun\n      times today.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Usually nothing helps me for the migrane, apart from suffering for 2-3\n      days and sleeping a lot. Nevertheless, I still gave it a try with 2\n      anti-migrene pills, the strongest ones I currently had in possession.\n      Those ones in particular were the best ones I could obtain in London\n      pharmacy months back when I was in similar migrene emergecy.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Today was the time to test them again. And guess what? A miracle happened!\n      The migrene stopped in around 2 hours and I was actually able to enjoy the\n      day and code until 20:40 pm :) And actually, I must say this day was\n      awesome! Because I was so happy with my performance. I did a lot of\n      progress on my issue, then also on change requests other team mates made.\n      Plus I even did a code review of an article a colleague wrote. I am\n      usually shy to do code reviews, cause... let's be honest how much relevant\n      input a Junior like me can contribute especially to code of people who are\n      10+ years experienced? Well, as this was an article about a setup I did\n      myself last week, I had some tips, omg, I actually had something to{\" \"}\n      <code>say</code> :) Feels like a queen..ehm, forget queen..{\" \"}\n      <code>goddess</code>!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So yes, today I was satisfied with my work and plenty of things which I\n      accomplished especially on my (first <code>real</code>) issue. It is\n      really a rewarding feeling when you are heading towards the finishing line\n      and you see the possibility (far away in the distance still hazy, but\n      yet...) of a <code>merge</code> :) Yes, ok, after the QA testing ofc.

I took a break to cry, eat\n      (whatever) (...ok all of the) sweets I had at home (which by the way was\n      an entire stock of rations for a month time of apocalypse...), then I\n      cried a bit again and afterwards on the recommendation of my mentor I took\n      the second look at it... and even a <code>bonus</code> third one... It\n      still looked the same... so I wrapped the working day up and hoped that\n      something magical will happen over the weekend, that on Monday I will wake\n      up and everything will be crystal clear and I simply do it... Let's see...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      As a rebellion to that I decided to make progress on meaningful stuff in\n      my life... and played Heroes of Might and Magic 5 until 2 am :) And then I\n      remembered that some time ago someone mentioned to me that humans should\n      actually engage themselves in something called sleep. Fair enough, I\n      should give it a try (from time to time). But before I went I randomly\n      opened an old chat with my skiing group only to find (completely random)\n      meme:\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/wZABOiR.png\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Phabulu1 from Imgur\"\n        border=\"5px\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      Those coincidences sometimes are <code>epic</code>.

Jupiii, will be\n      hell of a day. Literally ;) Maybe my soul will burn, and <code>\n        then\n      </code>{\" \"}\n      I get enlightened!

The starting point was.... to delete\n      around 10 complex files and do everything from scratch..\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Quoting my mentor:\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>Yes, remove all custom styles.</blockquote>\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/bTIkniG.gif\" alt=\"\" />\n      <br />\n      <br />I shed a tear and then made some very nice progress with the design\n      itself. Who care that all the functionality is missing :) The looks is\n      important, no? Nevertheless, it was fun coding today. Would be a perfect\n      day, if only I did not have to do some annoying <code>manual</code> work\n      for my ex-boss from my previous team. Who does not like filling out a\n      1000th spreadsheet manually, even though we have the same information\n      spread across 5 different softwares...? Well in year 2020 manual work\n      FTW... (or not)...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      I decided that rather then raging over it, I wrap it up for today and then\n      I had a great after-work training with my sports group. Love to get\n      sweaty!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And now time fooooor... wait for it.... gaming :) Another online\n      multiplayer appointment is awaiting for me, therefore I better get to it.\n      I do not want to get my sweet civilization in year 2070 wait for their\n      ruler :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/dKS2IBs.jpg\" alt=\"Photo from moddb.com\" />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 16: 24.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        When initial shock from pandemics subsides, you begin to live your\n        ordinary life.

Which means you stopped panicking and started adapting.\n        Because all emotions even panic has an expiry date when your body runs\n        into emotional exhaustion and that is the breakpoint when you embrace\n        your new situation and start acting to the best of your given\n        circumstances.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So yes, days start to pass in a very similar rythm. I certainly do not\n      miss travelling 3 hours a day for job. I can sleep longer and still start\n      my working day earlier than before. Which feels much more productive.\n      Which is certainly great. Also the isolation does not YET feel that\n      horrible. Because with modern technology I do feel connected to people\n      whom I want to be in contact with. This will probably change very soon,\n      because 1,5 week alone is still nothing compared to maybe months... or who\n      knows how long this situation is going to take. Prognosis do not look good\n      at all.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Back to coding. Speaking of general productivity, yes, I certainly work\n      more and more efficient. Today my boss re-prioritized my tasks and I had\n      to start a new issue, which I was able to also finish today. But the rest\n      of the day was very scattered as I still needed to finish some manual work\n      for my ex department and some clients decided that TODAY is the perfect\n      day to snow me under with emails. So deving was not as good as I wanted it\n      to be. But as I am still in dual position, torn apart between two\n      departnemnts, I need to grinch my teeth and simply do it. Soon, very soon,\n      I can hand over all my clients and focus 101% on programming, yay!!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And today I also started to learn about redux, so that I can make progress\n      on my issue. Wow, found a great tutorial from the author of redux, great\n      stuff... not that great English accent :) I really cannot make myself not\n      mentioning it, hahahaha, as I found it so difficult to understand him from\n      time to time, but overall the tutorial is absolutely awesome, very\n      educative, very insightful! :) So google it, go for it! In case you are\n      interested.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And evening was really great! Had an upper body training with my friend.\n      My legs are still crying from the leg training with him on Sunday. Was\n      time to destroy my arms as well. So that the Addania is finished off\n      completely :) Now that I am thinking about it, I wonder what his\n      intentions are.. and I even allow him to destroy me.. dammit :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/eLZBYsE.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Polina Tankilevitch from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 17: 25.03.2020 - Wednesday</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>Holy Mother of All Code!!</blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      I made it work!

Well, as I was so\n      dedicated to really make it on time today, I worked till 11 or 12 pm to\n      make it happen..\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      It did not happen.. as I still needed some feedback from colleagues, final\n      approval and QA testing.

I\n      mean... said a loving farewell to this <s>cursed</s> lovely PR..\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Time for the new issue! Yay! And this time on a different product.\n      Perfect! So let's make it start. I made sure and double-checked 2 weeks\n      ago, that everything is set and done on my computer for this product, I\n      tamed the Docker, I resolved all its issues, and now it shall bow to me\n      and obey my orders unless...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Unless you try to start the Docker again.. Or even better, it DID start..\n      but then I could not login to the platform! I mean really? I set my\n      credentials myself, they were in the .env file. Just how difficult is it\n      to copy paste creds from one file to the app? Incredible, it did NOT work.\n      How can it not work? Seriously Docker? Time to screw me up again?\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So happy times.. spent 3/4 of the day solving Docker issues again.. This\n      Docker - such a drama queen. I start to really think it is a female :)\n      Just look at the evidence:\n      <li>has its moods</li>\n      <li>is unpredictable</li>\n      <li> never does what you want it to do</li>\n      <li>\n        and I secretly even think it is vengeful (I mistyped it with \"i\" couple\n        of times)\n      </li>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So what I needed to do is to stop all the Docker, remove all containers,\n      wipe all the volumes, boot it clean all up again.. and of course pray to\n      the Almight Docker God.. Now I see that being a programmer will apparently\n      convert me to a believer!

Most importantly I tested an\n      issue of my friend, which made it special and fun. And then we spent\n      entire evening talking about it :) Was very nice. And right before going\n      to bed I did some midnight push-ups, just to keep my score ;)\n      <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jCYh6AG.jpg\" alt=\"Photo from dong.world\" />\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 24: 03.04.2020 - Friday</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Today I learned something new (the hard-way):\n      <blockquote>Ya shall nat juse component inception bro!</blockquote>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Well, it looked innocent when I defined a component within a component.\n      And my boss even approved the code and I was so happy that this issue I\n      did completely on my own... But then there are always people that put us\n      down from the momentary victory, back to earth, back to dirt :D :D :D\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So yeah, component inception is apparently not allowed in React, but in my\n      opinion, it looked cool. A colleague even said: \"I have never seen this\n      before\". See? I am unique with my ideas! I defy the contraints of the\n      system! I think outside of the box, I use unusable! I break all the rules\n      and ... break the app, potentially :) But still I am a rebel, a black\n      sheep of the React. So...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Me: \"Can we keep it?\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AmDekqY.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo from pinterest.com\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      They: \"How about...\"\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/DIyWu8O.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo from www.christianforums.com\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      Me: \"But...\"\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      They:\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cSmvi8b.jpg?1\"\n        alt=\"Photo from cdn.shopify.com\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      Me: \"Mmmkaaay...\"\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/s3kpZB8.jpg?1\"\n        alt=\"Photo from cdn.shopify.com\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 25: 06.04.2020 - Monday</strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So let me get this straight. We have already around 100 ways to define a\n      function - with word function, with const, arrow functions, functions with\n      return statement, arrows with explicit return, bla bla. Then we also have\n      one trillion itterators. For loops, for in loops, for of loops, foreach,\n      for WHAT NOT? Not to mention all the maps, filters, reducers, and other\n      ugly creatures living their own independent and higly unsettling life...\n      :) Poor developers who need to understand their complicated habits, feed\n      them and nurture them. And especially poor ME...\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Now guess what? Generators.. YOu hear it, generators .. another damn way\n      to define another damn function which is kind of a damn interator except\n      it is not :) Your head is already steaming? So is mine.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So yes, this is a new thing I learned today in my programming course. And\n      this is probably another thing I will forget tomorrow :) Luckily my head\n      is forgetful enough to actually do some natural DROP TABLE\n      brain_memories_of_useless_stuff_and_useless_people :) :) Thank you brain!\n      :)\n      <br />\n      Brain: \"Welcome!\"\n      <br /> Haha, this is literally the first time, I let my brain write\n      something! Or I am just crazy and should go to sleep as it is again almost\n      midnight and my main inspiration is coming at around this time. Cause, why\n      not, brain? :) <br />\n      Brain: \"Muhahahahaaaaaaaaaaa\"\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/jYUH9gn.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Mike from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <strong>Dev day 26: 07.04.2020 - (second) Monday, yes yes </strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Today was a confusing day as I was working on webcomponets. Because why\n      not to assign a JUNIOR (let's emphasize JUNIOR) FRONTEND (let's emphasize\n      FRONTEND) developr (if I can even call myself that way already) to a\n      partly backend issue? CCC.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      So, I tucked my sleeves and I made some research on my own. And you know\n      how it is, when investigating completely on your own something you have no\n      clue about. It feels like on an entirely new planet full of dangerous\n      carnivorous and most importantly hungry animals, where every step is a\n      mine-field. And then soon it can really become quite frustrating when\n      after 3-4 hours you are still at the beginning but having at least some\n      kind of a really vague idea of ... well, stuff.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      But then had a call with my boss. It turned out that I had been on a very\n      good way to solving the issue, I had identified almost every file and part\n      which I needed to amend. And why it was not entirely working was only\n      because I needed to run npm start again to see the changes. Wow, that is\n      cool. That means I did lots on my own. And then he explained many things\n      and I could made a great progress afterwards!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Evening was great, had an upper body trainign with friends where I was\n      giving my 120% (because I was feeling guilty after eating SO MUCH\n      chocolate today - you remember those carnivorous hungry animals, I\n      mentioned earlier?... they are to blame... they like chocolate too, they\n      MADE ME!). Then I played some nice board game session with my mum. And\n      afterwards my friend (kind of) challenged me to make some progress on the\n      \"executeprogram\" course boasting with his 70% progress on some courses.\n      Ok, fine! Challenge accepted. Sorry, no time for writing anything more,\n      need to catch up with him :)\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/b9sU97f.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Susanne Jutzeler from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <strong>Dev day 27: 08.04.2020 - Wednesday </strong>\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>XXX</blockquote>\n      when days start to pass in similar manner and the pattern starts to be\n      monotonous, I am not as motivated to write my brilliant ideas down. But\n      then I think again and I trully believe that we can always find something\n      beautiful in each day. And if I fail to find it, it feels like I kind of\n      dont deserve this gift that was give to me called life. Sooo as obviously\n      I DO deserve it, then let me find something amazing about this day! Hmm,\n      hmm, what makes it unique? Oh, hell yes, today, I did not eat sweets! You\n      dont believe it, I know, I dont believe myself either (cause actually I\n      just realized that I had like 3 pieces of 99% chocolate, damn, and I\n      almost got this one. BUT look, achivement of this day is that my mum came\n      to me while I was working and wanted to cheer me up and offered me a\n      regular chocolate. And I RESISTED the temptation, which means Im literally\n      an emobiment of a will of steel! :D :D :D I can control my mind, my body,\n      Im an Ironman, I mean Iron woman! SPARTAAAA /Flex flex Now thinking about\n      flexing, I have sore muscles from yesterdays upper body work out which I\n      enjoy. Having slight pain means I DID work out well enough, so I am\n      satisfied. Plus today I did unexpected HIIT training with a friend. It was\n      great because it was SPONTANEOUS and I like spontaneous, especially when\n      days seem to differ very slightly for menowadays. Work-wise I handed over\n      half of my remaining clients to a new starter. Wee, that definitely is an\n      achievement, as I'm slowly making progress to full dev position. Plus I\n      did some testing where I discovered I think 3-4 bugs or improvement\n      possibilites of the app. Nothing can escape my eagle eye!! Nobody needs to\n      know that those were completely unrelated to the PRs which I was suppose\n      to test and that I wasted probably 1 hours instead of 15 minutes doing the\n      tests. :D And my PR which I worked on, I did some nice progress and solved\n      many issues on my own. Ok, still some are remaining, but that is for\n      another day - another ME :) See, actually when you starts to really give\n      it an effort and think about your actual day and mini schievements, you\n      can always find some and sometimes many! It is not that hard, it is just a\n      mindset. Great, now I am happy with myself. Can go to sleep :) After\n      finishing my (5) programming courses (of course only because i want to win\n      an unofficial competition with my friend). I dont even know honestly what\n      the competition is about - maybe who finishes it first? haaha, no clue,\n      but the challenge is on.

And many of them told me some heart-catching\n      words of which I am extremely proud of but at the same time, it made me\n      feel sentimental. At such moments I really understand what I have been\n      building during those more than 4 years - bonds. Which can be tough\n      sometimes but strong and beautfiul at the same time!

I think it will be good to have it. Like this I will be able to\n        put all of above on it 😊. I wish you the best for you on your new\n        challenge.
