The day <code>0</code>, since obviously\n        all acceptably decent indices shall start with zero.\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />A day a bit chaotic as I was settling in my new corner of the\n      office.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      But a day with a <code>MohnKuchen</code> which propheted an excellent day.\n      After all, what can go wrong when you have a prospect of a delicious cake\n      and warm cup of tea from our CTO (Chief Tea Officer) to combat literally\n      ANY challenge in life? They say <code>piece of cake</code> for a reason,\n      don't they? :)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day when I <i>actually</i> talked to <i>actual</i> developers. And\n      they\n      <i> actually</i> talked BACK :) Thank you <code>MohnKuchen</code> ;)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with <code>muscle tomcat</code>. Yes, yes, dear Austrians: ein\n      Tag mit Muskelkater :) from previous day(s) of intense training and ...\n      let's admit it... carrying that <code>MohnKuchen</code> all the way to the\n      office.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day deeply satisfying as I finally achieved my long desired goal.\n      The hard work for past months has finally paid off. Dream turning\n      inevitably into reality right in front of my eyes. It seems a bit surreal,\n      it seems a bit... well plain even, earthy maybe. But <code>MINE</code>.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with a small <code>victory</code> to setup my first\n      professional dev environment.\n      <br />\n      <br />A day which ended up with an intriguing <code>puzzle</code> to look\n      forward to solving the next day :)\n      <br />\n      <br />A day with an after-work <code>hangout</code> which turned out to be\n      more pleasant than expected.\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>Total score: The day freaking ROCKED :)</blockquote>\n      <br />\n      And yes, the <code>cake</code> was the most important part of it :)\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aRwy8mP.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Antonio Quagliata from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 1: 03.03.2020</strong>\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        First things first... yes, leftovers from the <code>cake </code>\n        are still in the fridge... will be another great day :)\n      </blockquote>\n      <br />\n      And now back to the <code>puzzle</code> from yesterday: how to hack the\n      unhackable login to the app on my LOCAL? My wildly lucky guess{\" \"}\n      <code>admin admin</code> did not work. But I got an insider tip that the\n      second half of the riddle I have solved already, muhahahaha. So now only\n      to get the first one right.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Tadaaa! Mission accomplished! Addania +1 Hacker Skills. It is only my\n      second day and I am totally pro already :)) ...*cough cough*\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      Another achievement of the day: I made my very first{\" \"}\n      <code>code review</code> today B) It was extremely serious change request:\n      correct a typo, haha. One must always start somewhere :) Tough life of\n      beginners.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And I finally finished setup for the main app thanks to couple of (4)\n      people who helped me make it work after we realized that our internal wiki\n      is outdated and there are some backend issues.\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      And the highlight of the day was{\" \"}\n      <code>New Starters After-Work Pizza</code>. Technically I am not a new\n      starter in the company, however I am new starter in the dev team, so I\n      joined the event and it was hilarious to talk to my new team. They are\n      simply amazing and super funny. I love those dev jokes. I didn't want to\n      leave as I was having lots of fun, but the time was running short for my\n      Tuesday's Sports Group. It would suck if the teacher didn't arrive :)) So\n      I had to. And the yoga class was actually nice, relaxing, yet challenging.\n      Cause without a challenge it would be boring ;)\n      <br />\n      <img\n        src=\"https://i.imgur.com/aRwy8mP.jpg\"\n        alt=\"Photo by Antonio Quagliata from Pexels\"\n      />\n      <br />\n      <strong>Dev day 2: 04.03.2020</strong>\n      [img]https://i.imgur.com/nWoxCBd.jpg?1[/img]\n      <br />\n      <blockquote>\n        Excellent, I got an Italian cooking Italian lunch for me today.

All got approved and merged,\n      yay!\n      <br />\n      <br />\n      The evening was painfully funny. Or.. painful & funny? Or both at the same\n      time?
